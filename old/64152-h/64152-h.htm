<p class="ph1"><small>THE</small><br />
STRANGE VISITATION</p>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp; WILD night, with a gale of wind,
a wind that scratched and tore and
howled at doors and windows like an angry
cat spitting and spluttering&mdash;its miauling
voice now rising, now sinking&mdash;at one
moment savage, at another querulous, but
always incessant of complaint, with a
threatening under snarl of restless rage in
its tone. A wild night!&mdash;full of storm and
quarrel, with occasional dashes of cold rain
sweeping down on the shrieking blast like
gusts of angry tears&mdash;a noisy night in which
the elements were at open war with themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
making no secret of their hostile
intentions&mdash;and yet it was the one night of
all nights in the year when &#8220;peace and goodwill&#8221;
were the suggested influences of the
time. For it was Christmas Eve. Christmas
Eve! What a wonderful anniversary
it is, if we would but pause in our reckless
and senseless rush onward to the grave,
just to think quietly about it for a moment!
Long, long ago&mdash;yet but a short while since&mdash;if
we count by the world&#8217;s great epochs
of civilisation wherein a little two thousand
years are but a moment&mdash;a host of Angels
descended from heaven and sang a joyous
hymn of general amnesty to mankind on
the first Christmas Eve that ever was&mdash;and
according to the noble poesy of high-thinking,
God-revering John Milton:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent2">&#8220;No war or battle&#8217;s sound</div>
<div class="indent3">Was heard the world around,</div>
<div class="verse">The idle spear and shield were high up hung;</div>
<div class="indent3">The unhook&egrave;d chariot stood</div>
<div class="indent3">Unstain&#8217;d with hostile blood,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
<div class="verse">The trumpet spake not to the arm&egrave;d throng;</div>
<div class="indent3">And kings sat still with awful eye</div>
<div class="verse">As if they surely knew their sovran Lord was by.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent2">&#8220;And peaceful was the night</div>
<div class="indent3">Wherein the Prince of Light</div>
<div class="verse">His reign of peace upon the earth began;</div>
<div class="indent3">The winds, with wonder whist,</div>
<div class="indent3">Smoothly the waters kist,</div>
<div class="verse">Whisp&#8217;ring new joys to the mild oce&agrave;n,</div>
<div class="indent3">Who now hath quite forgot to rave,</div>
<div class="verse">While birds of calm sit brooding on the charm&egrave;d wave!&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>One wonders if&mdash;in those far-off days of
angel-singing&mdash;there was such a thing as a
millionaire? Not a merely &#8220;rich&#8221; man;&mdash;not
a &#8220;Wise Man of the East,&#8221; who,
possessing knowledge and insight as well as
wealth, hastened to bring his gold with
frankincense and myrrh, and to lay these
reverently in the humble manger which
served as cradle to a Child, whose vast power
was destined to conquer and subdue all the
mightiest kings of the earth:&mdash;but an actual
money-gorged, banknote-stuffed ruler of
some octopus-like &#8220;Trade,&#8221; whose tentacles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
clutched and held everything within its reach&mdash;some
owner of huge factories where human
creatures &#8220;sweated&#8221; their lives out to fill
his pockets, and died in their hundreds,&mdash;perchance
their thousands&mdash;in order that he,
like some monstrous bloated leech, should
swell to the point of bursting on the blood
he sucked from their throbbing arteries!
Was there such an one existing in the
miracle days when the &#8220;Glory to God in
the Highest!&#8221; rang from star to star, from
point to point of the myriad constellations,
like a great wave of melody breaking against
illimitable and endless shores? Surely not!&mdash;else
there would have been some break
in the music!&mdash;some ugly jar in the divine
chorus! For instance, if there had at that
time been living a multi-millionaire at all
resembling the one whose strange experiences
are now about to be related, the angels
would have fled in dismay and weeping
from the spectacle of a soul so warped from
good, so destitute of sympathy, so drained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
and dry of every drop of the milk of human
kindness, and so utterly at variance with
the &#8220;peace and goodwill&#8221; of which they
sang!</p>

<p>Yet no one will deny that a multi-millionaire
is a great man. What multi-millionaire
was ever considered otherwise? It was
the glorious environment of multi-millionaire-ism
that made Josiah McNason great&mdash;and
Josiah McNason was a very great man
indeed. Quite apart from his connection
with you and me, dear reader, as the immediate
subject of this story, he was great in
business, great in success, great in wealth,
great in power, and more than great in his
own opinion. Small wonder that he thought
much of himself, seeing that thousands of
people thought so much of him. Thousands
of people had him on their minds, and lay
awake at nights, uneasily wondering what
might be his next financial &#8220;deal.&#8221; For
on his little finger he balanced mighty
&#8220;combines.&#8221; At his nod &#8220;companies&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
collapsed like card-houses, or rose up again
with the aerial brilliancy of &#8220;castles in
Spain,&#8221;&mdash;the pulse of Trade beat fast or slow
as suited his humour,&mdash;speculators on
&#8217;Change whispered his name in accents of
mingled hope and terror,&mdash;aye, even kings
were known not to be averse to receiving
Josiah in private audience, though they
might, and did, deny the privilege to such
others of their subjects whose plea was one
of merit more than cash. The fact stood
out very patently to both royalty and
commons alike, that Josiah McNason was
a man to be reckoned with,&mdash;a man to be
studied and considered,&mdash;a man whose
moods must be tolerated, and whose irritations
must be soothed,&mdash;a man to be coaxed
and coddled,&mdash;a man to whom the highest
personages in the land might safely&mdash;(and
even advantageously)&mdash;send presents of
grouse and salmon in their seasons,&mdash;a man
whom it was considered politic not to offend.
But why? Why all this trouble and anxiety<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
from Majesty itself down to toiling bank-clerks,
with respect to the fits and vagaries
of one puny biped, neither handsome to
look at, nor pleasant to speak with, but
merely, taken as nature made him, an irascible,
cut-and-dry pigmy of a man, not worth
either a curse or a blessing, to judge by his
outward appearance? Oh well! Merely
because, by speaking him fair and flatteringly,
it might be easier to borrow money
of him! Everyone with even a small
surplus quantity of this world&#8217;s goods, knows
the taste of that diplomatic bread-and-honey
which is always cautiously administered
by one dear friend to some other
whose pockets are to be tested. Josiah got
such bread-and-honey all day long. Someone
was always feeding or trying to feed
him with it. His appetite however was
fastidious, and he seldom swallowed the
cloying bait. Even when he did gulp down
a large wedge of it with a distrustful smile,
it did not have the effect intended. Instead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
of softening his financial digestion and
rendering him pliable, it appeared to make
him harder and tougher in mental fibre.
The gleam in his cold expressionless eye
bored through the soul of the would-be-borrower
of cash like a gimlet, and divined
his intention before the said borrower could
so much as mumble out&mdash;&#8220;Could you&mdash;would
you, Mr. McNason&mdash;make me a
trifling advance?&mdash;offer good security&mdash;great
convenience to me just now!&#8221;&mdash;trailing
the sentence away into indistinguishable
fragments as Josiah snapped his thin pale
lips on the &#8220;No!&#8221; which, with sharp snarling
sound, hopelessly closed the discussion.</p>

<p>It was Christmas Eve,&mdash;and though this
fact has already been stated before, it cannot
for the purposes of the present veracious
chronicle of events be too strongly insisted
upon. It was the Eve of the Angels,&mdash;and
no devils were supposed to be anywhere
about. For, as our Shakespeare tells
us:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Ever &#8217;gainst that season comes</div>
<div class="verse">Wherein our Saviour&#8217;s birth is celebrated,</div>
<div class="verse">The bird of dawning singeth all night long,</div>
<div class="verse">And then, they say, no spirit can walk abroad;</div>
<div class="verse">The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,</div>
<div class="verse">No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,</div>
<div class="verse">So hallow&#8217;d and so gracious is the time!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Perhaps the great McNason, if he had not
been so occupied with himself and his own
affairs, might have thought of these lines
when, on leaving his head office in the city,
he travelled with the swiftness of the wind
through a storm of sleet and snow to his
palatial private abode some twenty miles
out of town, rushing along at full speed in
a superb motor-car sumptuously furnished
with a rain-proof covering, rugs, foot-warmers,
and all the luxurious paraphernalia
wherewith a multi-millionaire may
shield his valuable joints from the cold.
For he professed, did McNason, to have
Shakespearean proclivities, and had been
heard to declare publicly that he preferred
the Bard of Avon to the Bible. That was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
the way he put things,&mdash;with all the agreeable
free-and-easy indifference to religion
and to other folks religious sentiments which
so frequently embellishes the character of
the multi-millionaire. As a matter of fact
he knew nothing about either the Immortal
Plays or Holy Writ. They were sealed
books to his limited comprehension. The
divine teachings of Scripture, and the
broadly beneficent and tender philosophy of
Shakespeare were alike beyond him. He
understood Ledger Literature in its every
branch,&mdash;every smallest point concerning
L.S.D. was familiar to him,&mdash;and such
&#8220;quotations&#8221; from books as he could make,
were intimately connected with the Stock
Market. But for all romance he had a fine
contempt, and for poetry and poetic sentiment
a saturnine derision. More than anything
perhaps, he hated and scorned any
idea of things &#8220;supernatural.&#8221; He attended
church very regularly on Sundays,&mdash;oh
yes!&mdash;that was a particular item of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
&#8220;conscience and respectability&#8221; with him.
But as everything he heard there had to do
with &#8220;supernatural&#8221; matters, it is safe to
presume that he was a hypocrite in going to
listen to what he did not believe. However,
in this he was not exceptional,&mdash;there
are many like him. &#8220;Respectability&#8221; may
be permitted to play the humbug when it is
a millionaire, and drives to its country seat
in a motor-car costing two thousand guineas,
especially on Christmas Eve, which&mdash;despite
colossal fortune-makers&mdash;remains indissolubly
associated in the human mind with
Poverty and a Manger. And it was with all
the glow and splendour of humbug shining
lustrously about him that the world-renowned
McNason stepped out of his sumptuous
vehicle as it stopped at his own door,
and entered his stately baronial hall, where
four powdered and liveried flunkeys stood
waiting deferentially to receive him. Taking
scarcely any notice of these gorgeous
personages, who were in his sight no more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
than flower-pots, umbrella stands, or other
portions of ordinary household furniture,
he addressed himself to a fifth retainer,
severely attired in black, who, by a set of
cords and tassels on his left shoulder and
the effective simplicity of his costume as
compared with the liveries of the other
menials, implied to all whom it might concern
that he was the commanding officer or
major-domo of the royal McNason household.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anybody called, Towler?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yessir. Mr. Pitt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Pitt? Dear me! I saw him only
this morning at the office. What did he
want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t say, sir. He is waiting to
see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Waiting? Here&mdash;at this hour?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yessir. In the library.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a frown of irritation, the great
Josiah threw off his sable-lined overcoat,
which was received obsequiously by one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
the powdered lacqueys in attendance, while
a second accepted his hat with an air of
grateful and profound humility. Then he
walked slowly, deliberately, not to say in
heavy-footed style, along a broad corridor,
dimly yet richly lit by electric light filtering
through coloured glass, where classic marbles
were artistically grouped here and there in
snowy contrast with the dark fall of velvet
draperies and pyramidal masses of flowers,&mdash;where
Venus gazed from under her sleepless
lids, with white eyeballs astare at the ugly
little man who passed her without looking
up,&mdash;where Mercury, poising on tip-toe with
winged heels, appeared to meditate an immediate
flight from the wizened, wrinkled,
moneyed creature below him who was so far
and away from any conception of the god-like&mdash;and
where Psyche, bending over the
butterfly in her small caressing hands,
seemed almost to shudder lest the very
breath of the celebrated millionaire should
shrivel the delicate expanding wings of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
Immortal Soul she so tenderly fostered.
Preceded by the black-costumed Towler,
who threw open various doors majestically
as he advanced, Josiah entered the library,
warm and cheerful with the red heat and
glow of a sparkling log fire. A well-dressed
gentlemanly-looking man who had been sitting
near the table turning over a newspaper,
rose as he approached and stood a moment
without speaking, as though in some doubt
or hesitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Pitt, what&#8217;s the matter? Anything
gone wrong since this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir. Nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Then what are you here for at such
an hour and in such weather, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt hummed and hawed. He was
one of McNason&#8217;s most trusted overseers;
and at the great factories which daily ground
down human lives into the McNason millions,
he had under his management a very large
number of the men employed. The only
fault that could be found with him from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
a strictly business point of view was, that
he had some vestiges of a heart. These
vestiges were troubling him a little just
now.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was one thing I forgot to mention
to you in my report to-day,&#8221; he began;
&#8220;I can&#8217;t think how it slipped my memory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither can I!&#8221; and Josiah smiled a
hard smile&mdash;&#8220;Whatever it is, if <i>you</i> forgot
it, it cannot be of much importance!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt did not seem to perceive the
implied compliment to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps not,&#8221;&mdash;he answered
slowly,&mdash;&#8220;still I should blame myself if I
neglected it&mdash;I should certainly blame myself&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here he broke off and coughed nervously,
while McNason, drawing a large elbow-chair
to the fire, sat down and spread out his thin
veiny hands to the blaze in irresponsive
silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s about Willie Dove, sir&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
he said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>McNason looked up with peering eyes
that narrowed at the corners like those of
a snake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Willie Dove!&#8221; he echoed, slowly.
&#8220;H&#8217;m&mdash;h&#8217;m&mdash;let me see! Who is Willie
Dove?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely you remember him?&#8221; replied
Pitt, quickly, with a touch of warmth in his
tone&mdash;&#8220;Twenty-five years ago he was one
of the smartest travellers in your employ&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was he?&#8221; And McNason smiled
blandly, but indifferently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes of course he was!&#8221; and Mr.
Pitt&#8217;s voice grew still warmer with feeling
as he spoke&mdash;&#8220;Surely, Mr. McNason, you
can&#8217;t have altogether forgotten him? He
made immense business for the firm,&mdash;immense!
A wonderfully active and energetic
man,&mdash;never lost time or opportunity
and brought us no end of valuable custom&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right of him!&#8221; interpolated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
McNason,&mdash;&#8220;He did his duty, no doubt,
and was paid for doing it. Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt played absently with his watch-chain.
He was conscious that a check had
been summarily put on any eloquent dissertation
he might have been disposed to make
concerning the past abilities and qualifications
of Willie Dove.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought&mdash;I fancied you might perhaps
be interested,&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-five years is a long time, Pitt,&#8221;
said McNason, slowly,&mdash;&#8220;a very long time!
It is a quarter of a century. One&#8217;s interest
in any man is apt to exhaust itself naturally
in such a period.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt looked up quickly, and then
looked down. There was something in the
hard, furrowed countenance of Josiah that
suggested a mental dry heat or dry cold,&mdash;any
force in fact, that may be known to
absorb or disperse particles of generous
sentiment. Yet Pitt was not a coward, and
though he stood in wholesome awe of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
captious moods and whims of the great
millionaire upon whom his own existence
and that of his family depended, he determined
not to relinquish the errand on which
he was bound without a struggle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; he resumed, in accents rendered
firm by a kind of inward desperation,
&#8220;whether you are interested or not,
I think it my duty to tell you that Willie
Dove,&mdash;the man who through his energy,
fidelity and tact, helped to establish the
firm, is now lying seriously ill. He is nearly
sixty years old, and having a large family
to provide for, had been unable to put by
anything for his own rainy day&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He should not have had a large family,&#8221;&mdash;interpolated
McNason, stretching out his
lean ill-shaped legs more comfortably in
front of the fire&mdash;&#8220;it&#8217;s quite his own fault!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; proceeded Pitt, with considerable
emphasis, &#8220;if he had been less
honest and high-principled in his business
connection with us, he might have been more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
well-to-do in his own affairs. But, as matters
stand, his position is a sad one. He is
afflicted with a painful disease, which, however,
can be absolutely cured by an immediate
surgical operation. The doctors
assure him that he will be well and strong
enough to live out his full measure of years
comfortably and usefully if he will only
submit to their treatment&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if he wants to live, why doesn&#8217;t
he?&#8221; inquired McNason, lazily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Simply because he can&#8217;t afford it,&#8221;
replied Pitt, bluntly.</p>

<p>The great millionaire took up a poker, and
looking critically at the fire, broke a large
gaseous lump of coal into a bright blaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Well, that settles it,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Then I suppose he must, as the common
folk say, &#8216;go home&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>A sparkle of indignation lightened Mr.
Pitt&#8217;s quiet grey eyes. But he restrained
his feelings.</p>

<p>&#8220;The operation fee would be a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
guineas,&#8221; he went on in a calm business-like
tone&mdash;&#8220;Good nursing and a change of air
would perhaps run into a hundred more.
Say two hundred pounds. That sum would
save his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay!&#8221; And McNason&#8217;s thin lips
widened into a grin&mdash;&#8220;But if he hasn&#8217;t got
the two hundred, he must accept the inevitable.
After all, when a man is nearly
sixty, a few years more or less in the world
doesn&#8217;t matter!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt looked at his employer steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any cause of complaint or
offence against Dove, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>McNason met his inquiring eyes with his
own special gimlet glance, sharp as the
point of a screw.</p>

<p>&#8220;None! Not the least in the world!
Why should I? I scarcely remember the
man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you have nothing against him,
would you not perhaps be inclined to help
him? The claims of your business are, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
know, enormous, and it is of course easy
to forget the names and identities of the
various persons who have all done their
little best to build up the firm,&mdash;but Dove&#8217;s
is really an exceptional case. He was always
liked and respected at the works,&mdash;many
of the men there know him well and speak
most highly of him, and I can add my own
testimony to that of the others. It seems
a pity to let so faithful a servant of the
firm die for want of a little first aid&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he send you to beg of me?&#8221; asked
McNason with a kind of vicious abruptness.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt&#8217;s pale face flushed a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not, Mr. McNason! Willie
Dove would never beg of any man. He
merely told me his case and said: &#8216;Perhaps
Mr. McNason would lend me the money.
I would work it all back.&#8217; And to speak
the truth, I really thought&mdash;yes, sir, I really
thought you would be glad to lend it!&mdash;even
to <i>give</i> it! Two hundred pounds is
no more to you than two hundred pence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
would be to me. But supposing you make
it a loan, and have any doubts as to Dove&#8217;s
ability or willingness to pay it back, I
myself will be security for him. I would
advance him the money if I had it to spare,&mdash;but
unfortunately I am rather pressed
for cash just now&mdash;I also have a large
family&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>McNason smiled a smile resembling the
death-grin of the fabulous dragon of St.
George.</p>

<p>&#8220;A mistake, Pitt!&mdash;quite a mistake!
Large families merely make the world more
difficult to live in and money scarcer to
get! Money needs to be kept in close
quarters&mdash;close, very close quarters! It
has a habit of running away unless it is
imprisoned, Pitt! It runs away much
faster than it runs in! Governments know
that!&mdash;and kings! And when governments
and kings find it slipping through their
fingers, they come to Me!&mdash;to me, Josiah
McNason!&mdash;and I tell you what it is, Pitt,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
I&#8217;ve enough to do with lending money to
Big Persons and taking securities on Big
Things without bothering myself concerning
Little Commercials! See? I lend to
Royalties, Titles and Magnificences of all
classes and all nations,&mdash;and I&#8217;ve done so
much lately in this line that I&#8217;m short of
money myself just now, Pitt!&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;I&#8217;m
short of money!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt stared, and was for a moment
speechless. He had often thought (taking
shame to himself for indulging in such a
reflection) that Mr. McNason was certainly
a very ugly man, but he had never seen
him look uglier than at the present moment.
Such a mouthing, wrinkled mask of a face
as the firelight now flashed upon was surely
not often seen among living humanity.
Even the grey-white goatee beard that
adorned Josiah&#8217;s sharp chin, wagged up and
down with its possessor&#8217;s silent mirth in a
fashion which made its expression abnormally
atrocious.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m short of money!&#8221; repeated the
millionaire, rubbing his hands pleasantly
together&mdash;&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind lending this Willie
Dove five pounds, as you say he served the
firm well a quarter of a century ago,&mdash;but
two hundred! Now, Mr. Pitt, you&#8217;re a
sensible man,&mdash;a man of business,&mdash;and you
know that to ask such a sum on loan for
a decayed and diseased commercial traveller
is absurd! He would never be able to
&#8216;work it back&#8217; as he says. And as for
your being his security, I have too much
respect for you to allow you to put yourself
into such an awkward position. You&#8217;d
regret it,&mdash;you really would, Pitt! Besides,
why not let Dove go to one of the Hospitals
and take his chance among the young
students and general cutters-up of bodies,
eh? They&#8217;d charge him very little&mdash;perhaps
nothing&mdash;especially if they found his disease
complex enough for good &#8216;practice&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt gave an unconscious gesture of
physical repulsion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>&#8220;Mrs. Dove has a nervous horror of her
husband&#8217;s being separated from her,&#8221;&mdash;he
said, slowly&mdash;&#8220;She says that if he is taken
away to a hospital she feels sure he will
never come back. Then again, she has
great faith in the doctor who has been
attending Dove for the past six months&mdash;and
he strongly recommends a private
operation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course! He wants to put the money
into his own pocket,&#8221;&mdash;said McNason,
calmly&mdash;&#8220;Well! I can&#8217;t be of any assistance
in this business&mdash;so if that&#8217;s all you
came about, you may consider that you
have done your duty, and that the interview
is finished. Good-night, Mr. Pitt!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Pitt still hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Christmas Eve, sir,&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began,
falteringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is. I have been reminded of that
fact several times to-day. What of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, sir, except&mdash;except&mdash;that it
is a time of year when everyone tries to do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
some little kindness to his neighbour, and
when we all endeavour to help the poor
and sick according to our means,&mdash;and&mdash;and
when some of us who are getting old
may look back on our past lives and remember
the ones we have loved who are
no longer here,&mdash;when even you, sir,&mdash;you
might perhaps think of your only son who
is gone,&mdash;the son of the firm, as we used
to call him,&mdash;Willie Dove carried the child
many times on his shoulder round the
works to see the engines in full swing,&mdash;and
he was very fond of Willie&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;and&mdash;as
I say, sir, you might, perhaps, for the
dead boy&#8217;s sake, do a good turn&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused. The millionaire had half
risen from his chair, and was gripping its
cushioned elbows hard with both hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you!&#8221; he muttered in
choked accents&mdash;&#8220;How dare you use the
memory of my dead son to urge a beggar&#8217;s
plea! Why do you presume to probe an
old grief&mdash;a cureless sorrow&mdash;in an attempt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
to get money out of me! Because it is
Christmas Eve? Curse Christmas Eve!&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice sank to a hiss of rage, and
Mr. Pitt, nervously shrinking within himself,
sought for his hat and made towards the
door. A terrific gust of rain just then
swept against the windows like a shower
of small stones, accompanied by the shrieking
yowl of the wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Christmas Eve!&#8221; repeated McNason,
fixing his eyes with cold derision on his
abashed overseer&mdash;&#8220;Peace and goodwill!
That sounds like it, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; And he
shook one hand with a mocking gesture
towards the rattling casements. &#8220;Hear the
storm? Any angels singing in it, do you
think? Any God about? Bah! Christmas
is a vulgar superstition born of barbarous
idolatry! It serves nowadays as a
mere excuse for the lower classes to gorge
themselves with food, get drunk, and generally
make beasts of themselves! There is
no more &#8216;Peace and goodwill&#8217; in it than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
there is in a public-house beer fight! And
as for doing kindnesses to each other, I&#8217;ll
be bound there&#8217;s not a man at my works
who isn&#8217;t trying to get a bigger round of
beef or a fatter goose for himself than his
neighbour can afford. That&#8217;s charity! It
begins at home! <i>You</i> know that, Mr. Pitt!
Ha-ha! You know that&mdash;you have a large
family! Christmas is a humbug, like most
&#8216;religious&#8217; festivals&#8221;&mdash;here he stretched
his thin mouth into that unbecoming slit
which suggested smiling, but was nothing
like a smile&mdash;&#8220;I never keep it&mdash;and I do
my best to forget it! Good-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, sir,&#8221;&mdash;and Mr. Pitt, hat in
hand, stood for a moment facing his employer&mdash;&#8220;I
am sorry if I have troubled
you&mdash;or&mdash;or offended you! I did not mean
to do so. I hope you will excuse my boldness!
I made a mistake&mdash;I thought you
might be pleased to do something for an
old servant of the firm;&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;Good-night!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>The door opened and closed softly. He
was gone.</p>

<p>McNason looked after him with a frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like his impudence!&#8221; he muttered&mdash;&#8220;Like
his damned impudence! Following
me up here all the way from the city and
begging me to lend two hundred pounds
to a man I hardly ever saw&mdash;except&mdash;except
once or twice when my boy was alive.
Among the hundreds and hundreds of
travellers for the firm, how the devil should
I be expected to remember Willie Dove!&#8221;</p>

<p>He settled himself once more in his elbow-chair,
and poked the fire vigorously till the
bright blaze spread a brilliant glow well over
the room, flashing ruddily on the rows of
well-bound books, on the marble busts of
poets and historians, on the massive desk
strewn with letters and papers and lit with
electric reading-lamps at either end, and
on all the luxurious appurtenances for the
study of either Ledgers or Literature which,
in these days of superfluous comfort and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
convenience, assist in furnishing the library
of a millionaire. He had dined in town,
and there was nothing for him to do except
to read,&mdash;write,&mdash;or sit and meditate. He
was alone,&mdash;but that was his customary
condition when in his own house, unless on
those occasions when he chose to invite a
select party of persons, often including
Royalty itself, to stay with him as guests,
and graze on him, as it were, like sheep on
a particularly fat pasture. But he never
asked people to visit him at all unless for the
ulterior purpose of making use of them in
business; and just now he had no important
object in view that could be served by
dining or wining anybody. It was an awkward
time of year,&mdash;Christmas-time, in fact.
It is always an awkward time for anyone
who is incurably selfish. Those who have
homes and love them, go to such homes and
stay there with their families,&mdash;those who
are callous concerning home-ties and home-affections,
have been known to start for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
Riviera (especially that section of it known
as Monte Carlo) with &#8220;tourist&#8221; tickets or
otherwise;&mdash;in short, everybody has a way
of doing as they like, or, if not quite as they
like, as near to what they like as they can,
at that so-called &#8220;festive&#8221; season. One
naturally thinks that a multi-millionaire
would surely have all the amusements and
gaieties of the world at his command,&mdash;but
it seemed that Josiah McNason could find
nothing wherewith to amuse himself, all
business being at a standstill for a few days,&mdash;while
as for gaiety!&mdash;dear me, the very
word could barely have been uttered by the
boldest person after one glance at his face!
He sat, or rather huddled himself in the
depths of his chair with a kind of dull satisfaction
in his mind to think that in a couple
of hours or so he would be going to bed.
There was a damp and chilly feeling in the
air; the cry of the incessant wind was teasing
and shrewish&mdash;and he drew himself nearer
to the fire, finding comfort in its warmth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
and dancing flame. He began to con over
certain imposing figures representing the
huge sums realized by his firm during the
past half-year,&mdash;and, with furrowed brows,&mdash;so
harshly wrinkled that his grey eyebrows
met across a small chasm of yellow sunken
flesh,&mdash;he calculated that his own personal
fortune had accumulated to the colossal
height of nearly twelve millions sterling.
He moistened his lips with his tongue, drawing
that member between his teeth with a
sharp smacking sound as of satisfactory
nut cracking.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221;&mdash;he said, half aloud,&mdash;&#8220;I
think the time is ripe for a Peerage! I can
spare&mdash;now, let me see!&mdash;yes!&mdash;I can spare
the money! Twenty thousand pounds to a
hospital will almost do it! And perhaps
another twenty thousand in some more
private quarter, and,&mdash;a little diplomacy!&#8221;
He sniggered softly and rubbed his hands.
&#8220;Lord McNason will sound well,&mdash;very
well! If my son had lived&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>Here the heavy frown again made an abyss
of his brow. He stared into the fire with a
kind of melancholy sullenness, and began to
think. His thinking was half involuntary,
for he was not a man who cared to dwell on
memories of the past or possibilities of the
present. Yet, despite himself, he found
his mind wandering through various byways
of reminiscence back to the time when
he was young, with all the world before him,&mdash;when,
through the crafty instruction of
an over-moneyed American capitalist he had
learned by heart that celebrated paraphrase
of a well-known divine text&mdash;&#8220;&#8216;Do&#8217; others
as you would not be &#8216;done.&#8217;&#8221; He saw
himself practically adopting this rule of life
and conduct with brilliant results. He
traced the beginning of the great inflow of
gold which now encrusted him and rolled
him up as it were in a yellow metallic shroud,
a singular and separate creature, apart from
other men. He recalled against his own will
an incident in his career which he would fain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
have forgotten, when at about thirty-seven
years of age he had won the first affections
of a sweet and beautiful girl of seventeen
whom afterwards he had heartlessly jilted,
for no fault of her own, but merely because
her father had through sad mischance suddenly
lost his fortune. Then,&mdash;his mind
persisting in its abnormal humour of harking
back like a hunted hare to old covers,&mdash;he
reviewed the circumstances of his loveless
marriage with the daughter of a millionaire
who was at that time half as rich again as
himself,&mdash;and even now, though she was
dead, it was not without a sense of angry
pique and nervous irritation that he remembered
her utter callousness and indifference
to his personality,&mdash;her light regard for his
wealth, which she scattered recklessly on
every sort of foolish extravagance and dissipation,&mdash;and
her want of natural care and
affection for the one child which she gave
him,&mdash;a promising boy on whom he lavished
what infinitesimal vestiges of love still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
remained in his rapidly fossilizing moral
composition. He thought of all the anxiety
and cost which the education of this, his
sole heir, had entailed upon him,&mdash;anxiety
which was futile, and cost which was wasted.
For Death cannot be bribed off by bullion.
Typhoid fever in its most virulent form had
snatched away the boy when he was barely
eleven years old, and though the piles of
gold still continued to accumulate and ever
accumulate with the workings of the great
McNason firm, there was no one to inherit
the monster millions that came to birth with
every fresh turn of the business wheel.
And with his disappointment, Josiah had
adopted an opposition front towards Deity.
The &#8220;ways of Providence&#8221; were to him
subject for the bitterest acrimony; and
though, as has been said, he went to Church
regularly on Sundays, and was, indeed,
exceptionally careful to make a public show
of himself as a man vitally interested in all
Church matters, his action in this regard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
may be truly represented as having been
taken on the foundations of unbelief and
godless mockery. It tickled his particular
vein of humour to think that all the people
in the parish where he had his country seat
thought him a really religious man. It had
been so easy to get this reputation! A few
subscriptions to the rector&#8217;s pet charities;
occasional assistance in taking round the
collection-plate on Sundays; and a solemn
demeanour during the sermon, had done it.
But beneath that solemn demeanour what
acrid depths of diabolical atheism lurked,
only the diabolical agencies knew! He had
worked his way through the world by a
judicious use of the world&#8217;s follies, obstinacies
and credulities,&mdash;he had over-reached
his neighbours by making capital out of
their confidences,&mdash;and now, as much as
concerned the world&#8217;s chief god, Cash, he
was at the top of the tree. True, he was getting
on for seventy, but in these days when
&#8220;the microbe of old age&#8221; is on the point of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
being discovered and exterminated, that was
nothing. And the toiling engine of his brain
having shunted its way thus far into the
Long-Ago on a side line of its own, now
came rushing swiftly back again into the
present brilliant terminus of Wealth and
Power which he had so successfully attained.
And again the idea of a Peerage commended
itself to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It could easily be managed&mdash;quite
easily!&#8221; he mused; &#8220;And then&mdash;perhaps&mdash;I
might marry again&mdash;and marry well!
Some young woman of aristocratic birth
and high connections, who wants money.
There are scores of them to be had for the
asking!&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the clock on the mantelpiece
struck a sharp ting!-ting!-ting! Josiah
glanced at its enamelled dial and saw that
it had chimed the quarter-past eleven. The
fire was burning beautifully bright and
clear,&mdash;and the warmth thrown out by the
glowing coals was grateful to his shrunken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
legs, loosely cased in their too ample trousers.
He decided that he would wait a little
while longer before retiring to rest. Stretching
out one hand he touched the button of
an electric bell within his reach. Almost
instantaneously his major-domo, the majestic
Towler, appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Towler!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yessir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall want nothing more to-night.
You can go to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake me at seven to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yessir! To-morrow&#8217;s Christmas Day,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s that to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beg pardon, sir! Thought you might
like to sleep a little later, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josiah gazed at him grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sleep a little later! What do you take
me for, eh? D&#8217;ye think I&#8217;m such a fool and
sluggard as to want to stay in bed longer on
Christmas Day than on any other day?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
You ought to know me better than that!
I have plenty of work to do just the same,
Christmas Day or no Christmas Day, and
I mean to do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, sir. Yessir. Seven o&#8217;clock,
sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven o&#8217;clock, sharp!&#8221; And McNason&#8217;s
thin lips closed upon the word &#8220;sharp&#8221;
like the lid of a spring matchbox.</p>

<p>Thereupon Towler backed deferentially
towards the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, sir. Merry Christmas,
sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>And with this salutation,&mdash;which, offered
to a person so distinctly removed from
merriment as was his master, seemed almost
a satire,&mdash;he disappeared.</p>

<p>McNason, uttering a sound between a
grunt and a curse, poked the fire again
viciously, and flung on two logs from a
wood-basket beside him,&mdash;chumpy resinous
logs which began to splutter and crackle
directly the heat touched them, and soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
started flaring flames up the chimney with
quite a lurid torchlight glow. The storm
outside had increased in fury,&mdash;and hailstones
were now mingled with the rain
which dashed threateningly against the
windows with every wild circling rush of
the wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad I&#8217;m not going to a Christmas Eve
party!&#8221; thought Josiah, as he listened to
the hurrying roar of the gale&mdash;&#8220;A great
many young fools will probably catch their
deaths of cold to-night,&mdash;a wise dispensation
of Nature for getting rid of surplus population!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stretched each end of his mouth as
far as it would go, and showed his crooked
yellow teeth to the fire, this effort being
his way of laughing. The clock struck half-past
eleven,&mdash;and scarcely had its final
chime died away on the air when another
and unexpected sound startled him. Ring-ting-ting-ting!&mdash;ting-ring-ting-ting-ting!&mdash;Ring-ting-<span class="allsmcap">TING-TING</span>!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>&#8220;Someone at the telephone!&#8221; he said,
getting out of his comfortable chair, and
hurrying to that doubtfully useful modern
instrument, which, if once fixed in a private
house puts the owner of it at the disposal
of all his friends and business acquaintances
who may be inclined to &#8220;call him up&#8221; on
the most trivial excuses for wasting his
time&mdash;&#8220;Who wants me at this hour, I
wonder!&#8221;</p>

<p>He soon had his ear to the receiver, and
a small, shrill and quite unfamiliar voice
came sharply across the wire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he rejoined.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell-oh! McNason! Are you there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;m here. Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s telling!&#8221; And the shrill piping
accents broke into fragments of falsetto
laughter that ran vibratingly into McNason&#8217;s
ear and gave him cold shivers down his
back&mdash;&#8220;Are you at home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I am! Going to bed.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>&#8220;Oh! Don&#8217;t go to bed! Hell-oh!
McNason, don&#8217;t go to bed! I want you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Want me? What for?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the broken laughter quavered along
the wire in uncanny snatches.</p>

<p>&#8220;On business! Very important! Government
loan! No delay! Great chance
for you! Peerage! Christmas Eve! Don&#8217;t
go to bed!&#8221;</p>

<p>Josiah&#8217;s temper rose. He put his mouth
to the transmitter and spoke softly, deliberately
and with concentrated viciousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a humbug! You&#8217;re some fool
playing with the telephone because it&#8217;s
Christmas Eve, and you don&#8217;t know what
else to do with yourself! Probably you&#8217;re
drunk! I don&#8217;t know you, and I don&#8217;t want
to know you. Get off my private wire!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; And then came a curious exclamation
that sounded like &#8220;Hoo-roo!&#8221;
&#8220;Don&#8217;t say you don&#8217;t want to know me!
You&#8217;ve got to know me! I&#8217;m coming to
you now! Be with you directly!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>Josiah began to feel desperate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell-oh!&#8221; was the prompt response.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell you when I see you! Hand you
my card!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! Can you hear what I say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As plain as a penny whistle!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, whoever you are, please
understand that it&#8217;s no use your coming all
the way here to see me to-night. It&#8217;s too
late! This place is twenty miles from town
and there are no trains. The house is shut
up, and I&#8217;m going to bed. Your business
must wait till to-morrow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow is Christmas Day!&#8221; replied
the shrill voice; &#8220;To-morrow will be
here in half-an-hour! But I shall be
with you before then! My business won&#8217;t
wait! It can&#8217;t! Don&#8217;t worry about
getting supper for me,&mdash;I never take any!
Ta!&#8221;</p>

<p>Utterly mystified, McNason fell back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
from the telephone affected by that strange
and disagreeable sensation commonly called
&#8220;nerves.&#8221; He was not, constitutionally,
a nervous man,&mdash;his mental and moral
fibres were exceptionally tough and sinewy,
and though he was distinctly snarley and
irritable on the rare occasions when he
could not altogether get his own way, his
temperament was neither &#8220;highly strung&#8221;
nor over-sensitive. Nevertheless, he was
just now conscious of a vague uneasiness,&mdash;the
sort of physical discomfort which usually
precedes a severe chill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve caught cold in the motor,&mdash;that&#8217;s
what it is,&#8221;&mdash;he said, with a slight shudder,
&#8220;Such a beastly night as this is enough
to freeze a man&#8217;s blood! And I&#8217;m not so
young as I was&#8221;&mdash;here the ugly frown
deepened on his brow&mdash;&#8220;not so young&mdash;no!&mdash;but
young enough&mdash;young enough!
I&#8217;ll get into the blankets as quickly as
possible.&#8221; He glanced furtively at the
telephone. &#8220;Some impudent idiot has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
tampering with my wire, that&#8217;s pretty
certain! I&#8217;ll find out who it is to-morrow!
And I&#8217;ll make him pay for his fooling!&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned his eyes towards the fire. It
was brighter than ever. Slowly returning
to the deep easy chair placed so cosily
opposite the sparkling flames, he sat down
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get myself thoroughly warmed
through before going to bed,&#8221;&mdash;he decided,
spreading out his hands to the red glow&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m
actually shivering! There must be
snow in the air as well as rain!&#8221;</p>

<p>His teeth chattered, and though the blaze
from the fire was already so strong and
vivid, he used the poker again to break
asunder a half-consumed lump of coal,
which on being split emitted a leaping
tongue of gaseous blue flame.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better!&#8221; he remarked approvingly,
half aloud, &#8220;That looks cheerful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it does!&#8221; said a shrill voice at his
ear,&mdash;the same voice precisely that had just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
called to him along his &#8220;private wire&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Quite
cheerful! And Christmassy! As
cheerful and Christmassy as yourself,
McNason!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a violent start Josiah looked sharply
round&mdash;and looking, uttered an involuntary
cry of terror. On the cushioned arm of his
elbow-chair sat, or rather squatted, an
Object&mdash;a Creature&mdash;a kind of nondescript
semi-human thing such as drunkards might
possibly see in delirious dreams. It was
small as regarded its Head, but large as
regarded its Paunch. It had tiny legs, thin
as a chicken&#8217;s wish-bone. It had long
spidery arms with which it reached down
and embraced its turned-up toes. At a first
glance it appeared to have a smooth doll-like
countenance, but with the least movement
such a variety of odd expressions
came into play as to make each feature
seem a different face. Its eyes were large,
and abnormally brilliant. Its hair, jet
black and very oily, was rolled back from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
its narrow brows in the &#8220;all-round frame&#8221;
style of the present-day coiffeur&#8217;s art, while
on the top of this inverted nest, or soup
plate, it wore a conical red cap adorned at
the extreme point with a glittering fiery
tassel. Its attire&mdash;or rather that part of
its body which seemed to be clothed&mdash;was
red; its attenuated arms and legs were
naked, yellow, and extremely hairy. It was
more like an unpleasantly huge spider with
a human head than anything else, and
though small enough to curl itself up on
the arm of an easy chair, it was yet large
enough to create fear and repulsion in the
mind of even so important and powerful
a personage as a multi-millionaire. Josiah
McNason was distinctly afraid of it. And
that he was so, is no discredit to him. He
had never seen anything like it before.
And he had no particular wish to see anything
like it again. Yet he could not take
his eyes off it. Its eyes were fixed on him
with equal pertinacity. With a mighty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
effort at rallying his wits he stealthily
sought for the poker,&mdash;if he could get hold
of that useful instrument with his right
hand, he thought, and give that queer
Shape squatting so close at his left a heavy
<span class="allsmcap">WHACK</span>!&mdash;why then it would surely break
to pieces,&mdash;crumble&mdash;smash&mdash;disappear&mdash;!</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheerful and Christmassy like yourself,
McNason!&#8221; repeated the Creature, at this
juncture&mdash;&#8220;Don&#8217;t try hitting me with the
poker, that&#8217;s a good fellow! You&#8217;ll hurt
yourself if you do!&mdash;you really will! A
blow on this&#8221;&mdash;and it touched its protuberant
Paunch significantly&mdash;&#8220;would send you,&mdash;not
<span class="allsmcap">ME</span>!&mdash;into the middle of Next-World&#8217;s
week! And you&#8217;re not ready for Next-World&#8217;s
Week yet, McNason! There are
a few little business matters concerning it
which you don&#8217;t quite understand! Live
and learn, you know! And how <i>are</i> you?
You&#8217;re looking a bit lantern-jawed,&mdash;not
very well preserved! I&#8217;ve seen finer men
than you at your age!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>A cold perspiration broke out all over
Josiah&#8217;s body as he found himself mysteriously
compelled to meet the dreadfully
glittering round eyes of the uncanny Object
that discoursed with him thus familiarly.
Faintly he managed to stammer forth&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who the &mdash;&mdash; are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were going to say &#8216;Who the Devil
are you&#8217;&mdash;and why didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;&mdash;retorted
the Creature, rapidly untwisting one hairy
arm from the embrace of one hairy leg and
diving into its red body-covering, from which
it produced a small card on which certain
letters danced and flickered like tiny dots
of flame&mdash;&#8220;Who the Devil am I? Here,
the Devil, is my card! Promised you, the
Devil, I would hand it to you, and so, the
Devil, I do! Name&#8217;s quite easy, you&#8217;ll
find!&#8221;</p>

<p>With shaking fingers McNason gingerly
accepted the card held out to him by the
unpleasant looking claw which served his
visitor for a hand, and with great difficulty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
owing to the constant jumping up and down
of the inscribed characters, read:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Professor Goblin</span>,<br />
<span class="gap2">Hell&#8217;s United Empire Club.</span></p>

<p>McNason&#8217;s fingers shook more violently
than ever, and he hastily dropped the card,
which as it fell, curled up like a firework bag
in a Christmas cracker, emitted a clear blue
spark of light, and vanished into space.</p>

<p>&#8220;The title of &#8216;Professor&#8217; isn&#8217;t really
mine,&#8221;&mdash;explained the Creature, blinking at
him with its owl-like orbs&mdash;&#8220;I took it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sinking back in his chair, Josiah covered
his eyes with one hand and groaned. He
must be very ill, he thought!&mdash;he must be
sickening for some fatal malady! His brain
was going!&mdash;and this terrible visitation&mdash;this
hallucination of his senses, was the sign
and effect of a mental disorder which had
come on suddenly and was rapidly growing
worse! How long&mdash;how long would it
last!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>&#8220;Lots of fellows do it,&#8221;&mdash;observed the
Goblin, after a brief pause.</p>

<p>Some compelling influence forced the
panic-stricken millionaire to speak&mdash;to reply&mdash;in
fact to keep up conversation, whether
he liked it or not.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lots of fellows do what?&#8221; he murmured
feebly, still holding one hand over his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Call themselves Professors when they&#8217;re
not,&#8221;&mdash;said the Goblin.</p>

<p>Here ensued a moment&#8217;s intense stillness.
Even the noise of the storm outside had, for
that short interval ceased,&mdash;the fire burned
silently,&mdash;and not a breath stirred the air.
Only the glowing tassel on &#8220;Professor&#8221;
Goblin&#8217;s cap waved to and fro as though
moved by an unfelt wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I rang you up on the telephone
just now,&#8221;&mdash;resumed the Goblin&mdash;</p>

<p>But at this McNason jumped in his chair
and uncovered his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> rang me up?&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;!&#8221; he
stammered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I! Who did you think it was,
eh? Your &#8216;private wire&#8217;? Oh, Beelzebub!
Nothing&#8217;s &#8216;private&#8217; to me! I should
ring up the Prime Minister out of his bed if
I happened to want him!&#8221;</p>

<p>McNason felt the muscles of his back
stiffening in horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would?&mdash;you would&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly! I often use telephones!
Capital things! They have to do with the
currents of the air, you know!&mdash;and other
folks work on currents of the air besides
Humans! Humans aren&#8217;t the only people
in the universe! Don&#8217;t look so scared,
McNason!&mdash;I won&#8217;t hurt you! As I remarked
before, when I rang you up just
now, I wondered what title I should take to
ingratiate myself with you. You like titles,
I know!&mdash;you&#8217;ve been thinking of a Peerage
for yourself&mdash;quite right too! Get all you
can, McNason!&mdash;get all you can that
money will buy! But as I never deal in
Honours now, I couldn&#8217;t pass myself off as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
Duke or an Earl. The man that sells these
things is more in your line than mine. And
I gave up brewing beer and running &#8216;party&#8217;
newspapers long ago, so I could hardly be a
Lord. Besides Lords are getting so common&mdash;frightfully
common, McNason! In fact
Lords are becoming Commons! Oh, Beelzebub!
Excuse the joke! And as for being
a &#8216;Sir&#8217;&mdash;oh, hoo-roo, hoo-roo!&#8221; And the
Goblin, untwisting itself, beat its large
paunch slowly in the fashion of a drum,
evoking a dreary hollow sound which almost
made McNason cry&mdash;&#8220;Only a provincial
Mayor would accept it nowadays! I half
thought I&#8217;d say I was a Colonel or a General,&mdash;but
then you&#8217;d have taken me for an
American,&mdash;and I wouldn&#8217;t be an American
Bounder for twenty Next-Worlds! Then
I decided I would be &#8216;Professor.&#8217; &#8216;Professor&#8217;
struck me as being quite the proper
thing;&mdash;nice-sounding, wise and imposing!&mdash;and
anyone can call himself a Professor&mdash;even
a palmist who robs poor silly dupes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
of money for telling their fortunes which
neither he nor anybody knows! Hoo-roo!
Hoo-roo! What humbugs there are in the
world, McNason! <i>You</i> know that! You&#8217;re
one!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not!&#8221; said Josiah, indignantly,
aroused to sudden defiance. &#8220;How dare
you say I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare I!&mdash;How dare I!&#8221; crooned
the Goblin, clasping its legs again and rocking
itself to and fro&mdash;&#8220;Oh, Beelzebub!
How high and mighty we are! I dare do
anything, McNason! Anything! I&#8217;ll skin
your soul!&#8221;</p>

<p>Josiah gave a smothered cry of terror.
Such eyes as were now bent upon him were
like nothing in the world except railway
signal lamps with the light in them very
much intensified and enlarged.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll skin your soul!&#8221; repeated the
Goblin, severely&mdash;&#8220;And you won&#8217;t like the
process. Do you know what the process
is called, McNason? No? Then I&#8217;ll tell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
you! It&#8217;s a blistering, flaying, scorching,
boiling, steaming, tearing, crunching, blasting,
stripping&mdash;(don&#8217;t groan like that,
McNason!)&mdash;stabbing, cutting, piercing
process called Truth! It will rip off all the
lies in which you are so comfortably wadded,
as lightning rips off the bark from a tree!
And it will show you to be exactly what
I say&mdash;a Humbug! A pious Fraud, McNason!
A rich man who does no good
with his money! A hard man who grinds
down poor lives into ill-gotten gold! A
cruel, avaricious, grasping, selfish man!
And yet you go to Church every Sunday
and pretend that you&#8217;re a Christian!
Oh, hoo-roo! Uncharitable, mean, narrow-minded
and hypocritical, you are anything
but a good man, McNason!&mdash;and I&#8217;ve come
to tell you so!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gathering up his courage under this
volley of abuse McNason turned round in
his chair and deliberately faced his accuser.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a Bad Dream!&#8221; he said slowly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>&mdash;&#8220;You&#8217;re
the result of Cold and Indigestion!
You&#8217;re&mdash;you&#8217;re Nothing! But if
you were Anything, I should tell you you
are an impudent scoundrel and liar! I
should tell you to get out of this room
before you are kicked out! But you are
only an Illusion!&mdash;a horrible, horrible
Fancy!&mdash;and&mdash;and you&#8217;ll Go!&mdash;presently!&mdash;in
a little while&mdash;when I am better&mdash;when
my brain recovers itself&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here he broke off, appalled at the indescribably
hideous grimace with which his
unpleasant companion favoured him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your brain!&#8221; echoed the Goblin.
&#8220;<i>Your</i> brain indeed! Pooh! When you
are better! Hoo-roo! You never will be
better&mdash;never&mdash;not unless <i>I</i> doctor you!
I must sk&mdash;k&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; cried Josiah, seized by a
paroxysm of fear&mdash;&#8220;Don&#8217;t skin me! Anything
but that! Don&#8217;t,&#8221;&mdash;and his teeth
clattered together&mdash;&#8220;don&#8217;t ski&mdash;i&mdash;in
me!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>&#8220;Professor&#8221; Goblin relaxed its writhing
features and smoothed them into a kind of
wise impassibility such as is seen on the
physiognomy of a Chinese idol.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now answer me, McNason,&#8221; it said,
impressively&mdash;&#8220;Do you mean to say that
you consider yourself a good man?&#8221;</p>

<p>Josiah looked at his inquisitor with one
eye askew.</p>

<p>&#8220;As good as any man,&#8221;&mdash;he muttered&mdash;&#8220;And
better than most!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hoo-roo!&#8221; and the dismal cry was
like a hundred owls hooting in chorus&mdash;&#8220;Hoo-roo!&mdash;hoo-roo!
How these conceited
mortals deceive themselves!&#8221; Here
it patted its paunch echoingly. &#8220;As good
as any man, are you, McNason?&mdash;and
better than most! Now what have you
done in order to get such a very excellent
opinion of yourself, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>McNason hesitated. Then the recollection
of his vast wealth, and of his wide-reaching
business influence flashed across<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
his mind and filled him with a sudden
spirit of self-assertiveness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done a good deal in my time,&#8221;&mdash;he
said, boldly&mdash;&#8220;For one thing, I&#8217;ve
made my own way in the world!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! And without assistance?&#8221; queried
the Goblin&mdash;&#8220;Without trampling any poor
person down? Without &#8216;sweating&#8217; labour?
Without cheating anybody less &#8216;sharp&#8217;
than yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>McNason was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>haven&#8217;t</i> made your own way in
the world!&#8221;&mdash;went on the Goblin relentlessly&mdash;&#8220;The
men who have worked for
you have made it! And you&#8217;ve screwed
their lives down, McNason!&mdash;screwed them
down hard and fast to pittance wages in
order to wrest every penny you could for
yourself out of their labour! And you&#8217;ve
made a pile of money! Too big a pile by
far, McNason! No man in the world makes
such a pile without having wronged his
fellow-men in some way or other! He has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
tried to tip the balance of justice falsely&mdash;but
there&#8217;s one thing about that balance,
McNason&mdash;it always rights itself! When a
man is too rich&mdash;when a man has gotten
his money through close-fistedness, harshness
and avarice, then <span class="allsmcap">WE</span> come in! We
of Hell&#8217;s United Empire Club! We give
a bloated millionaire fits, I can tell you!
When he has got enough gold to gorge
himself with expensive food and wine every
day in the week if he likes, we take away
his digestion! That&#8217;s capital fun! We
take away his digestion, and the doctors
come and limit him to milk and soda!
Oh, hoo-roo!&#8221; And the Goblin doubled
itself up in a writhing tangle of delight,&mdash;&#8220;And
when he marries for Money <i>only</i> and
gets an heir to Money <i>only</i>, we take away
the heir! And then by and bye he finds
he can neither eat nor sleep, and that his
Money isn&#8217;t such a valuable commodity as
he thought it was, not even though it <i>can</i>
buy a Peerage! And when he is harsh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
and unkind and uncharitable, we sk&mdash;k&mdash;in
his soul!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <i>not</i> uncharitable!&#8221; cried Josiah,
goaded almost to frenzy by the darting
menace of the terrible eyes that glared
fixedly into his own&mdash;&#8220;Not even YOU can
say that! I&#8217;ve given hundreds and hundreds
of pounds away in charity&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On subscription lists&mdash;yes! I know
you have!&#8221; and &#8220;Professor&#8221; Goblin
nodded sagaciously&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen your name
writ large along with the names of a lot
of other bounders who want the world to
see how much they&#8217;ve given to a hospital!
But that&#8217;s not charity!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not charity!&#8221; echoed Josiah. &#8220;Then
what is charity?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I tell you?&#8221; said the Goblin.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve heard, but you&#8217;ve forgotten!&#8221;
And it repeated in a low, almost gentle
voice&mdash;&#8220;&#8216;Charity suffereth long and is
kind, charity envieth not; charity vaunteth
not itself, is not puffed up, Doth not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own,
is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;
Rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in
the truth; Beareth all things, believeth
all things, hopeth all things, endureth all
things.&#8217; That&#8217;s as unlike <i>your</i> charity,
McNason, as Heaven is unlike Hell!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any devil can quote Scripture!&#8221; said
McNason, contemptuously&mdash;&#8220;I hear all that
in Church!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hear, but you don&#8217;t listen,&#8221;&mdash;said
the Goblin&mdash;&#8220;You go to Church every
Sunday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do! My clergyman relies very much
on my assistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he now?&#8221; and the Goblin put
its head questioningly on one side&mdash;&#8220;Financial
assistance, of course?&#8221;</p>

<p>McNason gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the only kind of assistance he
ever asks for!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good man!&#8221; said the Goblin, thoughtfully&mdash;&#8220;And
you help him?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>&#8220;Very considerably.&#8221; Here McNason
drew himself up stiffly with an air of importance&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m
a Churchwarden.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this &#8220;Professor&#8221; Goblin uttered a
frightful yell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoo-roo, hoo-roo, <span class="allsmcap">HOO-ROO</span>!&#8221; it cried,
&#8220;The dear old days! The sweet familiar
word!&#8221; And springing suddenly into the air,
it turned a rapid somersault and came gravely
squatting down again&mdash;&#8220;Oh, Beelzebub,
McNason! I was once a Churchwarden!&#8221;</p>

<p>Josiah trembled in every limb, and his
tongue clove to the roof of his mouth in
sheer panic. The alarming abruptness of
his unwelcome visitor&#8217;s movements almost
paralysed him with terror. Somehow he
had thought the Creature might be a kind
of fixture to the arm of his chair,&mdash;an
hallucination of his eye and brain which
was likely perhaps to stay in one position,&mdash;but
its eldritch screech and somersault
upset his logic altogether and turned him
sick and dizzy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>&#8220;I was once a Churchwarden!&#8221; said
the Goblin, beginning to emit a spluttering
laugh from a grimacing mouth&mdash;&#8220;Oh, hoo-roo!
And I looked <i>so</i> respectable! Tell
me, McNason!&mdash;do you wear a top-hat
on Sundays?&#8221;</p>

<p>The shuddering millionaire bent his head
feebly in assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;So did I! So did I!&#8221; And the
Goblin clasped its toes and hugged itself
in a kind of ecstasy&mdash;&#8220;And a black frock-coat!
So nicely brushed! So well-fitting!
I had a figure in those days, McNason!
And I walked into Church with brightly
polished boots, creaking just a little to
show they weren&#8217;t paid for&mdash;because it
isn&#8217;t &#8216;gentlemanly&#8217; to pay for what you
wear right down on the nail, you know!&mdash;and
I bent my back before all the people
and breathed good little prayers into the
crown of my top-hat, just where I could
see the name of the hatter printed in gold
on the silk lining! I did! Oh, they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
happy days! Happy humbug days! Gone,
gone, gone! I shall never be a Churchwarden
any more!&#8221;</p>

<p>Here, unravelling its contorted body, it
put its clawlike hands up to its face and
began to weep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hoo-roo!&#8221; it blubbered&mdash;&#8220;When
I was a Churchwarden people were all so
respectful to me! I had a country seat&mdash;such
as you have, McNason!&mdash;and a whole
parish bowed down to me! Think of
that! Farmers doffed their caps, and
farmers&#8217; wives curtsied to me! The clergyman
spoke of me as his &#8216;high-minded and
generous neighbour!&#8217; Oh, hoo-roo! I was
so proud of myself!&mdash;as proud as a Scotch
landlord!&mdash;and nothing&#8217;s prouder than
that! Hoo-roo! Hoo-roo! Those happy
humbug days! I gave myself such airs!&mdash;such
touch-me-not airs, McNason! I
might have been an up-to-date Highland
chief in a kilt, my airs were so superior!
You know what an up-to-date Highland<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
chief is, McNason?&mdash;a man who lets his
&#8216;dear native home,&#8217; and his &#8216;beloved&#8217;
moors and forests for all he can get, and
lives a gay life in London on the profits!
A proud and pompous creature, McNason!&mdash;and
I was just such a one! I was really!
Talk of patriotism and love of country!
I had it all!&mdash;I was as parochial as a town
clerk! I had such a grand manner!&mdash;so
stand-offish! And now&mdash;and now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
Here it beat a dreary tattoo on its expressive
Paunch&mdash;&#8220;Oh, hoo-roo!&mdash;I shall never
be a Churchwarden any more!&#8221;</p>

<p>A clammy perspiration bedewed Josiah&#8217;s
brow. That hollow drumming sound was
dreadful!&mdash;if the horrible Creature would
only stop it!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that!&#8221;&mdash;he muttered, feebly,
&#8220;I&mdash;I can&#8217;t bear it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t bear what?&#8221; demanded the
Goblin, quite briskly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That sound you make on&mdash;on&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On my Tum-Tum? Oh, Beelzebub!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
You oughtn&#8217;t to mind that! Tum-Tums
are what all you men live for nowadays!
One of your dramatists has made a play
out of a Tum-Tum. Poor old Shakespeare!
He was never as clever as that! I always
lived for my Tum-Tum&mdash;and of course it&#8217;s
now the largest part of me. I have to tell
it everything,&mdash;and when I beat it, it
knows what I mean!&#8221;</p>

<p>Josiah huddled himself back into the
depths of his easy chair and closed his
eyes,&mdash;if he could only swoon away, he
thought!&mdash;if he could but lose his sight
and hearing in a merciful unconsciousness!&mdash;</p>

<p>A low snarling murmur, breathing through
the casements, under the door, and down
the chimney, now gave warning of the
fresh and fiercer rising of the wind, and
presently down it swooped with a terrific
battery of hail, and such a scream and
uproar of rage as is seldom heard save in
tropical forests, when huge trees fall crashing
under the blow of a storm, and torrents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
hurl themselves headlong from the summits
of the mountains sweeping tons of granite
with them like straws into the valley below.
At that instant the clock began striking
Midnight. One!&mdash;Two!&mdash;Three!&mdash;Four!&mdash;Five!&mdash;and
to McNason&#8217;s horror the
Goblin suddenly sprang upright. If it had
looked uncanny before, it looked a thousand
times more uncanny now. Poised on the
arm of the chair its lean toes and legs
began to stretch,&mdash;its body to lengthen,&mdash;taller
and taller it grew, its Paunch showing
as prominently and roundly as a full moon
on a winter&#8217;s night,&mdash;its head with its oily
hair, conical cap and tassel seemed to be
rising steadily into the ceiling, and Josiah,
clenching his hands convulsively, watched
the process in fearful fascination,&mdash;was this
the way the awful hallucination would
vanish? Was it going?&mdash;would the horrible
Nightmare elongate itself gradually
into fine lines, and, mingling with the
atmosphere, disappear altogether?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>Six!&mdash;Seven!&mdash;Eight! The gale rampaged
violently outside and shrieked like a
drunken fury, battering at the casements
as though meaning to break them in. Nine!&mdash;Ten!&mdash;Eleven!&mdash;and
lo!&mdash;the Goblin all
at once pounced down from the height to
which it had ascended, and laid its detestable
claw on the shuddering McNason&#8217;s shirt-front!
Twelve! With a wild whistling
yell, the storm burst open the long latticed
windows at last, throwing them back with
a savage <span class="allsmcap">BANG</span>!&mdash;blowing aside the splendid
damask curtains as though they were rags,
and admitting a gust of bitter cold sleet and
snow, while clear on the rushing blast came
the sound of bells! Ding&mdash;dong!&mdash;ding!&mdash;dong!
Do re mi&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">FA</span>!&mdash;Sol la&mdash;si&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">DO</span>!
The rhythmic beat and liquid warble of rich
tones melted into the wind and rain like a
kind familiar voice arguing with angry children,&mdash;but
Josiah McNason, half dead with
fear at the sight of the hairy claw on his shirt-front
and the knowledge that the red<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
moon-like Paunch of the Goblin was almost
touching his own shrunken one, heard
nothing save the howling of the furious gale,
and wondered how long this inexplicable
torture of his body and brain would last!</p>

<p>&#8220;Christmas Day!&#8221; cried the Goblin,&mdash;&#8220;It&#8217;s
Christmas Day, McNason! Hark to
the bells! How they swing! How they
ring! Come to church, McNason! It&#8217;s
time! Come along!&#8221; And the round eyes
glowed like balls of flame&mdash;&#8220;Come to
Church! Come and sing &#8216;While Shepherds!&#8217;
You&#8217;re a Churchwarden, you know! Come
along&mdash;come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now&mdash;not now!&#8221; gasped the terrified
Josiah, seeing that the Goblin was
spreading out its long lean arms as though
to envelop him in its embrace&mdash;&#8220;It&#8217;s not
time!&mdash;it&#8217;s the middle of the night!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&mdash;it&#8217;s Christmas Day!&#8221; reiterated
the Goblin; &#8220;Come to Church,
McNason! Come and hear my friend the
Reverend Mr. Firebrand hold forth on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
vanity of riches! Come in the spirit of One
Timothy Two! That&#8217;s a text! &#8216;Grace,
mercy, peace!&#8217; Come along, McNason!
All are welcome where <i>we</i> are going!
Hark! How the bells ring! One Timothy
Two! One Timothy Two! Come and &#8216;sit
under&#8217; good Mr. Firebrand! Come!&mdash;come!&#8221;</p>

<p>And with a terrible downward clutch,
the Goblin caught hold of McNason by the
coat-collar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy&mdash;&mdash;mercy!&#8221; cried the wretched
man&mdash;&#8220;Help!&mdash;Help!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Help!&mdash;help!&#8221; shouted the Goblin,
derisively&mdash;&#8220;One Timothy Two! Come
along, McNason! Come along!&#8221;</p>

<p>Catching up Josiah as easily as though
he were a wooden mannikin, the Goblin
unfurled a pair of bat-like wings and rose
aloft in air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we go!&#8221; it yelled&mdash;&#8220;Up we go,
and down we go! Off to Church! <span class="smcap">Me</span> and
the Churchwarden! Oh, hoo-roo, hoo-roo!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
Christmas Day and Christmas Bells, and a
jolly Christmas altogether! One Timothy
Two! Off we go!&#8221;</p>

<p>And with the rush and roar of the wind,
the Goblin carrying the world-renowned
millionaire as a bird of prey might carry a
rabbit or a weasel, soared out on a wave of
mingled sleet and snow into the stormy
night!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What happened to him in that wild supernatural
scurry through the air Josiah
McNason never knew. He lived and was
conscious,&mdash;conscious of being borne along
at a furious rate not knowing whither,&mdash;conscious
of the freezing cold,&mdash;the rain,
the wind, that tossed him and his unearthly
companion about like dead leaves on its
angry breath with a &#8220;Hoo-roo!&#8221; louder
than the cry peculiar to the Goblin itself,&mdash;conscious
above all of the bells! O the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
Bells! How they trilled and trolled out
their Christmas melody!&mdash;how they seemed
to tumble one over the other in their haste
to proclaim &#8220;Peace and Goodwill!&#8221;&mdash;how
their metal throats palpitated and throbbed
with the angelic message!&mdash;angelic still,&mdash;angelic
always!&mdash;even though some mortals
nowadays are so miserably-minded as to
doubt its truth and sweetness! The Bells
rang everywhere!&mdash;loudly to the scudding
clouds,&mdash;softly to the darkened earth,&mdash;whisperingly
among the chill showers of
sleet and snow, and with an echoing clang
like musical thunder above and around the
shadowy drifting form of the Goblin as it
flew along, gripping the quivering Josiah
as a cat might grip a mouse, or an eagle a
new-born lamb. All at once the rattle and
rush of the warring elements rolled off in a
pause of quietude, letting the Bells have it
all their own way,&mdash;and&mdash;suddenly descending
with lightning-like rapidity by sheer
force of the Goblin&#8217;s imperative downward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
pressure, Josiah found himself standing on
his feet in the middle of a vast building
which looked like a Church, though there
was no sacred emblem of religion to be seen
anywhere in it save the Pulpit. The Pulpit
stood out with singular obtrusiveness, for
it was green,&mdash;a livid, wicked green like the
glare of a serpent&#8217;s eye. Panels of white
appeared to be inserted round it, but these
could not be plainly discerned, at once.
The green hue was its chief note of attraction,
and McNason&#8217;s eyes fastened themselves
upon this with a pertinacity surely inspired
by some other influence than his own.
Breathless, shivering and exhausted as he
was, there was something about that Green
Pulpit which, wholly against his will, compelled
his attention,&mdash;and as he looked, he
heard a sudden confused murmur of voices
which, beginning softly at first, grew louder
and louder till it rose into a perfect pandemonium
of howling! The unhappy millionaire
trembled. What new and nameless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
horror was there yet in store for him?
Involuntarily he turned to look for the
Goblin,&mdash;even <i>that</i> uncanny Presence seemed
kinder and more friendly than such a dreadful
uproar of unknown tongues! And he
was actually glad to see it still standing beside
him, its round eyes sparkling with a
strange light of mingled mirth and malice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, McNason, how do you feel after
your airship voyage?&#8221; it inquired&mdash;&#8220;A
bit air-sick?&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the howling voices grew fiercer and
more shrill,&mdash;and yet the alarmed Josiah
could see nothing. He felt desperately
inclined to take hold of the Goblin&#8217;s claw
for protection.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&mdash;what&#8217;s that?&#8221; he stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only Church!&#8221; replied the Goblin&mdash;&#8220;Firebrand
is a strong preacher! He
&#8216;draws&#8217; like a magnet&mdash;or a dentist.
There&#8217;s always a crowded congregation to
hear him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Church!&mdash;a strong preacher!&mdash;a crowded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
congregation! McNason stared and stared,
seeing nothing but the Green Pulpit and
empty space, till all at once the Goblin took
off its conical cap and with the tasselled
point of that headgear touched his eyes.
Then&mdash;then&mdash;oh, then! But who can describe
that &#8220;then&#8221;! Who in mere words
can picture the amazing scene disclosed of
which he, Josiah McNason, was a part, and
to which he seemed to be the only human
witness! All round him, in front of him
and behind him were Goblins,&mdash;Goblins
big, Goblins little, Goblins fat, Goblins lean,
Goblins straight, Goblins crooked&mdash;Goblins
of every imaginable size and shape&mdash;Goblins
of every possible distortion or monstrosity
that ever appeared on the pages of a child&#8217;s
fairy book, were here in their scores, and all
attired in the queerest motley. Some wore
women&#8217;s enormous hats trimmed with fantastic
bows of ribbon and big waggling
plumes,&mdash;others had coloured caps like those
which are put into very cheap Christmas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
crackers,&mdash;some were decked out with flashy
tiaras and crowns that looked as if they were
cut out of tin-foil,&mdash;others again had their
strange sticky hair dressed as high as surely
an hair, sticky or otherwise, could go, and
surmounted with fantastic wreaths and
garlands of bright coloured flowers apparently
made of paper, under which they
minced and grinned like female gymnasts at
a rough country fair,&mdash;and all of them were
jostling, pushing, squeezing, and crowding
together, each one taking a seemingly mischievous
delight in trying to elbow its neighbour
out of place. It was a fearsome sight!&mdash;and
still more fearsome did it become
when a great ball of fire suddenly bounced
down from Nowhere and burst with a loud
report at the foot of the Green Pulpit,
where, spreading out a peacock&#8217;s tail of
vivid flame, it lit up the wicked livid colour
of that edifice with blinding brilliancy.
Josiah McNason&#8217;s soul froze within him.
He was dead, he thought!&mdash;he must be dead!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>In a swooning access of speechless terror
he clung to the Goblin, and was in a vague
way comforted when it tucked its hairy
arm through his and leered at him quite
amicably.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be nervous, McNason!&#8221; it said,
&#8220;It&#8217;s all right! Firebrand always likes
the electricity turned on when he preaches!
He&#8217;s the &#8216;star&#8217; actor of the piece, you see,&mdash;the
light must show him up more than
anyone else. There he is!&#8221;</p>

<p>Josiah gazed at the Green Pulpit in
quaking awe and aversion as a black figure
suddenly sprang up in it like a jack-in-the-box,&mdash;a
tall, lanky, clothes-prop sort of
shape, with a head like a large mop, from
which the hair, of a fiery red, hung down
in disordered tangles. This Goblin&#8217;s best
feature consisted in its attire, which was
of a double-dyed inkiness, with a wonderfully
smooth and silky &#8216;shine&#8217; upon it, suggestive
of black-lead. It was an unfortunate costume,
however, so far as concerned its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
becomingness to the face of its wearer,&mdash;a
face white as a bleached bone, with
prominent eyes which appeared to goggle
out of their cavernous sockets like pebbles
rolling each on the edge of a hole,&mdash;and the
sable clothing of the creature only intensified
the awful pallor of its countenance, and
brought out its worst points into the
strongest possible relief. McNason had
barely time to notice these details, which
seemed to be insistently forced upon his
attention, when his ears were again assailed
by renewed howling and screeching, accompanied
by a tremendous sound of drums,
as if all the drummers that were ever born
were drumming their way through the
world. Every Goblin had a protuberant
paunch,&mdash;and as &#8220;the Reverend Mr. Firebrand&#8221;
arose in the pulpit they all started
together beating a prolonged tattoo upon
these appendages to their otherwise skeleton
forms. And ever over the frightful noise
rang the Bells!&mdash;always the Bells!&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
Bells of Christmas,&mdash;the Bells of peace and
goodwill! Do, re, mi, <span class="allsmcap">FA</span>!&mdash;Sol, la, si&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">DO</span>!
Ding-dong!&mdash;ding-dong! Swinging and
swaying, the echoes rose and fell&mdash;and in
the midst of the pulsating chimes, the
Goblins burst into a chorus of wild shouting&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Firebrand!&mdash;Ha ha!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good old Firebrand!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Order, order! Silence for Firebrand!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha-ha, <span class="allsmcap">HA</span>! Ha-<span class="allsmcap">HA</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Firebrand! Hoo-roo! Hoo-roo!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then&mdash;as though they had been all
clashed together by one stroke into silence&mdash;the
Bells ceased. The shouting and
laughter and Paunch-drumming of the Goblins
likewise eddied away into a dull murmur&mdash;and
the Goblin in the Green Pulpit raised
a skeleton hand with the first-finger-bone
elevated as a signal for attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friends!&#8221; it began&mdash;&#8220;My dear
brethren&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha-<span class="allsmcap">HA</span>! Ha-ha-<span class="allsmcap">HA</span>!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>And the crowd of uncanny creatures
twisted and writhed with ecstasy, tossing
their queerly decorated heads about, and
spreading their wide mouths into elastic
grins which seemed to swallow up all the
rest of their faces. As if in sympathy with
the general hilarity, the &#8220;Reverend Mr.
Firebrand&#8221; grinned also&mdash;a peculiar and
very ghastly grin indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friends!&#8221; he or It resumed&mdash;&#8220;How
good it is for us all to be here! What a
sign of regeneration&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha-ha-<span class="allsmcap">HA</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of penitence&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha-ha!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of unselfishness and charity&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha-ha-ha!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of hope for the future&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoo-roo! Hoo-roo!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of everything beautiful, pleasant, and
truthful! Oh, how good it is to know that
we are thus assembled together, and that
we have among us a Human Creature,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
unlike, yet so like ourselves! Oh, my dear
friends! &#8216;Lest we forget,&#8217; let us remember
that we were all Humans once! All
Humans!&mdash;all Humbugs!&mdash;and such respectable
Humbugs too! Oh, my friends,
let us turn our thoughts back along the
tide of Time&mdash;the tide of Time is such a
fine expression!&mdash;and reflect on those
days&mdash;the days of frock-coats and top-hats!
The days when we were <span class="allsmcap">GOOD</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha-ha-<span class="allsmcap">HA</span>! Hoo-roo! Hoo-roo!&#8221;</p>

<p>Screams of laughter echoed through the
dim space, where now, faintly discernible
through a floating red vapour, the trembling
Josiah caught sight of the glittering tubes
of a great organ, and scarcely had he seen
this when <span class="allsmcap">CRASH</span>!&mdash;went the keys with a
droning and discordant thunder. A hideous
black scarecrow of a Goblin, waving its
paws or claws about fantastically, began
performing on the instrument, whereat all
the impish congregation burst out yelling
in chorus:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Renewed yelping, and &#8220;hoo-roos&#8221; of
diabolical laughter followed this vocal
effort, and the miserable Josiah McNason<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
felt cold trickles of perspiration running
down his back as he listened. Yet he
could not speak. Speech for the moment
was taken from him,&mdash;he tried to utter
some word&mdash;some ejaculation,&mdash;but his
tongue was stiffened in his mouth as though
it were paralysed. And he was forced to
pay close attention to the &#8220;Reverend Mr.
Firebrand&#8221; whether he liked it or not.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh my friends!&#8221; pursued that grim
and ghastly preacher&mdash;&#8220;How I thank you
for that beautiful hymn! How sweetly it
expresses our innermost feelings! Does it
not, my friends? Oh yes, indeed it does!
And our brother here&mdash;our Human brother&mdash;does
it not express <i>his</i> feelings likewise?
Yes&mdash;oh yes!&mdash;indeed it does!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-<span class="allsmcap">HA</span>!&#8221; shrieked the
Goblins&mdash;&#8220;Indeed it does! Ha-<span class="allsmcap">HA</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our Human brother,&#8221; went on &#8220;Mr.
Firebrand&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;is a &#8216;good&#8217; man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoo-oo! Hoo-roo!&mdash;Hoo&mdash;oo!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A &#8216;good&#8217; man because, my friends, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
has made Money! Money is Morals,&mdash;Morals
are Money! Our Human brother
is a rich man,&mdash;therefore virtuous. Virtue,
as you all know, consists in being rich,&mdash;Vice
in being poor. Our Human brother is
also a wise man. Wisdom consists in
looking after Number One. He does that!
He has always done it admirably! Number
One is to him the centre of the universe.
And we sympathise with him, do we not,
my friends? Oh yes, oh yes, we do!
For we also, in former days&mdash;we also looked
after Number One. Not One Timothy
Two! No&mdash;no! One Self One! That was
our text in life. And we acted up to it,
did we not, my friends? Oh yes, we did&mdash;we
did! We should not be here now if
we had not looked after Number One!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoo-roo!&mdash;oh&mdash;oh&mdash;Hoo-roo!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the wild cry had a dismal note in it
this time like the shriek of the wailing
wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again, my friends,&#8221;&mdash;went on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
Goblin &#8220;Firebrand,&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Our Human
brother is a charitable man. We all know
what charity is, do we not? Oh yes, we
do! Charity begins at home! Charity
never gives a penny away unless it can get
something for itself out of the bargain!
Charity never subscribes to anything unless
it can see its name printed on a subscription
list! That&#8217;s Charity, my friends!&mdash;as
<span class="allsmcap">WE</span> understand it&mdash;as our Human brother
understands it! The Charity which distinguished
<span class="allsmcap">US</span> when we,&mdash;like our Human
brother,&mdash;wore frock-coats and top-hats on
Sundays, was a charity which suffered
nothing and was never kind,&mdash;envied everybody,&mdash;vaunted
itself greatly,&mdash;was always
puffed up,&mdash;often behaved itself unseemly,&mdash;sought
its own,&mdash;was easily provoked,&mdash;thought
evil of most things,&mdash;rejoiced in
iniquity,&mdash;hated the truth,&mdash;bore nothing,&mdash;believed
nothing,&mdash;hoped nothing,&mdash;endured
nothing! This is the Charity of Human
Nature&mdash;material Human Nature!&mdash;and our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
Human brother is a glorious living example
of it! Soon&mdash;oh yes!&mdash;very soon!&mdash;our
charitable Human brother will give twenty
thousand pounds to a hospital. How
generous! How noble! The poor and sick
will benefit,&mdash;but our Human brother will
not be left out in the cold! Oh no! He
will buy a Peerage with the money and
also with an additional &#8216;little diplomacy.&#8217;
And he will be a lord!&mdash;oh my brethren,
how great a thing it is to be a lord! Do
we not know this? Yes, indeed, indeed
we do! Some of us have been lords, and
some of us have been commons. Both sets
have their advantages. But when one is
a lord, one can do so much! One can
become the &#8216;noble&#8217; director of bogus
&#8216;Companies,&#8217; and pocket a fee for attendance
at every meeting! And one can owe
bills to one&#8217;s tailor for an indefinite period!
And one can sell one&#8217;s self and one&#8217;s
&#8216;nobility&#8217; to any American female title-hunter
who will pay sufficient cash down!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
Oh yes, my brethren, it is a great thing to
be a lord! And when our Human brother
is a lord, he will be so proud and glad
that he won&#8217;t know himself! He is a
good man now, but when he becomes a
peer, he will be a better one! Oh yes,
my friends!&mdash;the world and Human Nature
generally will find him better, wiser, more
generous, more charitable, more everything
that is pleasant, beautiful, and truthful!
Will it not be so? Yes, indeed it
will be so! We know it will be so, for
we were all &#8216;good&#8217; men! I myself was
a &#8216;good&#8217; man&mdash;once!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-<span class="allsmcap">HA</span>! Ha-ha-ha-ha!&#8221;</p>

<p>And like twisting boughs of trees in a
storm, the goblins swayed and rocked
themselves to and fro, convulsed with
laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say I was a &#8216;good&#8217; man!&#8221; repeated
the demon preacher, leaning down over the
edge of the green pulpit, and rolling its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
goggle eyes at its audience, particularly at
the shuddering McNason&mdash;&#8220;Good in the
sense that you and I and our Human
brother understand goodness! I wore a
top-hat&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha-ha!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>And</i> a frock-coat&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha-ha!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I went to Church every Sunday&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha-ha-<span class="smcap">Ha</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I took round the collection-plate&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha-ha!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I always put a sixpence into it
myself&mdash;never less&mdash;never more!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha-ha-ha! Ha-<span class="smcap">Ha</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When any poor man asked me to help
him, and said he had a large family to
keep, I told him he shouldn&#8217;t have a large
family&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha-ha-ha!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never sacrificed my own comfort
or convenience at any time on any account,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
and I never parted with a penny I thought
it better to keep! I was a most respectable
man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoo-roo-oo! Hoo-roo!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my friends, I will ask you in
the spirit of One Timothy Two to consider
the interesting subject of my discourse,&mdash;our
dear Human brother! He, too, is most
respectable! He is even more than respectable,
for he is a millionaire! And
not only a millionaire, but a multi-millionaire!
He is all Money! Oh, my friends,
how good it is to be all Money! All
Money and no Heart! Heart is never
respectable&mdash;it is always a scoundrel!
Always trusting the wrong people, loving
the worst sinners, and making a fool of
itself in business! Oh yes, my friends,
Heart is desperately wicked! But our
dear Human brother has none of it. Let
us congratulate him! Especially at this
time of year,&mdash;this dreary, melancholy,
grumbling-time&mdash;when all the world&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
tiresome little children want holiday treats,
and all the tradesmen send in their bills,&mdash;this
wretched, stupid, depressing season
when even <span class="allsmcap">WE</span> are made uncomfortable&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoo-oo-oo! Hoo-roo!&#8221;</p>

<p>And now the Goblins beat their paunches
desperately and instead of laughing, began
to weep. One cadaverous-looking creature
took off its woman&#8217;s hat, large as an extra
large lamp-shade, and shed tears into it
as though it were a bucket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;ee!&mdash;ah&mdash;ee!&#8221; it sobbed&mdash;&#8220;How
I do hate the compliments of the season!
I always did! When I was a Human, I
always had to tip my butler and my coachman
on what they called Boxing Day!
They expected it,&mdash;the Brutes! Ah&mdash;ee!&mdash;ah&mdash;ee!
Such bitter, bitter memories!&#8221;</p>

<p>Other wailings and groanings of a similar
nature arose in chorus, and even Josiah
McNason&#8217;s own particular companion goblin
moaned and blubbered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> a terrible time!&#8221; it whimpered&mdash;&#8220;A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
terrible, terrible time! Everybody
expects everybody else to give them something!
Such a waste and such an expense!
Oh, hoo-roo!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Josiah essayed to speak,&mdash;but his
tongue still refused to utter.</p>

<p>&#8220;At this depressing period,&#8221; went on the
ranting &#8220;Firebrand&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;When stupid Humans
wished each other to be &#8216;Merry&#8217;
without any cause for merriment, it is a
great joy to find so sensible and practical
a person as our dear, rich, wise friend Mr.
Millionaire McNason among us! Yes, my
brethren, it is a great joy! For <i>he</i> never
wished anyone a &#8216;merry&#8217; or even a happy
time in his life, and quite right too! He
never wanted to be &#8216;merry&#8217; himself&mdash;never
felt like it&mdash;never looked like it! He is
the master of a great Business and has no
time for Sentiment. Sentiment is an imbecile
quality pertaining to girls, women
and fools. And our Human brother is not
a fool! Oh dear no! He is living precisely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
as he wishes to die;&mdash;he is making
himself into one of <span class="allsmcap">US</span> with all possible
speed! And how clever that is of him!
His only regret is that he will have no use
for Money when he becomes a member of
our United Empire Club:&mdash;and that to be
a lord will give him no extra privileges!
Otherwise, he is perfectly satisfied with
Himself&mdash;just as we all used to be perfectly
satisfied with Ourselves! And are we not
satisfied with ourselves still? Oh yes, my
brethren!&mdash;oh yes, we are satisfied, because
we are compelled to be satisfied! There is
no getting out of Our condition! We chose
it, We made it, and here We are! And in
the spirit of One Timothy Two, we exhort
our Human brother to continue in the self
righteous way he is going! We beseech
him never to be &#8216;merry,&#8217; never to be kind!
We implore him never to either lend or give
money to those in need, not even to an old
and faithful servant! For old and faithful
servants are just as great humbugs as any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
other class of persons! Moreover gifts are
always resented, and kindnesses considered
as merely personal advertisements of generosity!
Let our Human brother always be
as he is now, and so shall he reap the just
reward of his labours! The just reward!&mdash;the
just reward&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the bells suddenly began again,
pealing their chimes with a delicious softness
as though far, far away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soon, very soon,&#8221; continued the &#8220;Firebrand,&#8221;
lifting both its skeleton arms aloft
from the enshrouding folds of its black
draperies&mdash;&#8220;for our Human brother the
joys of money-making will be no more!
Soon, very soon, the demands upon his
Purse will cease, and his weary eyes will
close for the last time upon the pleasant
sun! Soon, very soon, he will hear no more
&#8216;compliments of the season&#8217;&mdash;nor will he
be troubled by the hand-shake of a friend,
or the suffering appeal of the sick and needy.
Soon, very soon, his ears will be deaf to all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
entreaties or messages&mdash;he will not even
hear the message of the Bells! The Bells!&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the Goblins all began to jump and
dance up and down, up and down,&mdash;and
turning their hideous faces towards Josiah
McNason they bowed and bobbed before
him, shouting and shrieking:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Bells! The Bells!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The message of the Bells!&#8221; reiterated
the demon orator, waving its bony hands
excitedly&mdash;&#8220;Grace, mercy, peace! One
Timothy Two! Soon, very soon, our dear
Human brother will be offended by that
message no more! Soon&mdash;very soon&mdash;he
will be one of <span class="allsmcap">US</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a tremendous effort, Josiah suddenly
regained his speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; he cried, with extraordinary
passion&mdash;&#8220;Never will I be one of You!
Never, so help me God!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, a sudden terrific roar of
mingled flame and wind sounded in his
ears,&mdash;the peacock&#8217;s tail of light playing up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
like foam against the Green Pulpit leaped
to an abnormal height, and swallowed up
the &#8220;Reverend Mr. Firebrand&#8221; in a twinkling,&mdash;then,
spreading itself into a rolling
stream of fire it swept over the crowd of
Goblins and drove them all helter-skelter
before it like dead leaves drifting in a hurricane,
engulfing them all out of sight save
one,&mdash;the self-styled &#8220;Professor&#8221; that still,
with its bone of an arm thrust familiarly
through McNason&#8217;s, remained beside him
as it were &#8220;on guard.&#8221; The Green Pulpit
vanished, and nothing remained of the
whole shadowy building that had seemed
to be a Church, save the great organ, where
now instead of a Goblin, sat a boy acolyte
dressed in a little white surplice. Under
his tender young fingers the notes breathed
tremulously but sweetly, and presently he
opened his cherub mouth and sang:</p>

<p>&#8220;O be joyful in the Lord, all ye lands,&mdash;serve
the Lord with gladness and come
before his presence with a song!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>Here the anthem was taken up by some
mighty invisible choir:</p>

<p>&#8220;Be ye sure that the Lord He is God;
it is He that hath made us and not We
Ourselves&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And all at once a white cloud filled the
near and distant spaces like the rushing-in
of a wave, and on this opaque pearly vapour
came floating a great number of dazzling
Angelic Shapes, wonderfully fair, gloriously
beautiful, carrying palms in their uplifted
hands and singing:</p>

<p>&#8220;Glory! Glory to God in the highest!
And on earth, peace and goodwill! Glory
to God!&#8221;</p>

<p>Stricken with a great awe, Josiah McNason
looked and listened. He trembled violently.
Should he kneel? He wondered! He had
often <i>pretended</i> to kneel in Church&mdash;though
he had really only bent his back slightly
for convention&#8217;s sake, but now&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>Before he could make up his mind one
way or the other the Goblin&#8217;s clutch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
descended once more upon his coat-collar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, McNason!&#8221; it whispered,
&#8220;We must go now! We&#8217;re not wanted
here! Come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Leave me alone, for Heaven&#8217;s
sake!&#8221; muttered Josiah pleadingly&mdash;&#8220;Let
me stay here! Why take me away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? Because they&#8217;re beginning to
keep Christmas! We don&#8217;t believe in
Christmas, do we? We say &#8216;Curse Christmas&#8217;
don&#8217;t we? Of course we do! Come
along! <i>You&#8217;re</i> not wanted and <i>I&#8217;m</i> not
wanted! One Timothy Two! Off we go!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another terrible rush and hurry-scurry
through unknown heights and depths of the
stormy air, and then with a sudden swoop
and pounce, the Goblin dumped Josiah
McNason down outside the garden gate of
a pretty cottage in a quiet country lane.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
Here, as if by magic, the sky cleared to a
bright blue, and the sun shone out brilliantly.
Birds began to sing, and the scent of a
thousand flowers perfumed every light
breath of wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little bit of sunshine, McNason!&#8221;
whispered the Goblin&mdash;&#8220;It&#8217;s winter time
for a good many Humans in many places,
but it&#8217;s always summer here. It&#8217;s what <span class="allsmcap">WE</span>
call a &#8216;spiritual&#8217; climate,&mdash;not affected by
outside conditions!&#8221;</p>

<p>The suffering millionaire, breathless, exhausted
and conscious of a great aching
pain at his heart, gazed at the peaceful
scene before him in silence. It was a very
little garden upon which he looked,&mdash;a mere
tea-cup of a garden,&mdash;but full to the brim
of the sweetest blossom. The cottage to
which the garden belonged was likewise
very small, but it had a deep and cosy
porch, up which the loveliest jessamine
clambered and threw out tufts of odorous
white spray. Red roses thrust their warm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
glowing faces through the masses of snowy
bloom, and, twining in friendly garlands,
showered their velvety petals at the feet
of a fair woman who sat just within the
porch, with her arms thrown round a sturdy
boy of some nine or ten years old. She
was well worth the homage of the roses&mdash;for
she was very sweet to look upon,&mdash;fresh-complexioned
as the bloom on a peach,&mdash;soft-eyed,&mdash;full-bosomed,
and of an aspect
expressing the serenest peace, love and
tenderness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once upon a time!&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother!&#8221; cried the boy she clasped,
&#8220;That&#8217;s the old way of telling a story!
Try some other way!&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling, there&#8217;s no other way! Everything
was &#8216;once upon a time&#8217; wasn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; The little fellow looked up at her
seriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think so! You could never
say you were my mother &#8216;once upon a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
time,&#8217; could you? You are my mother
always!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Always!&#8221; she murmured&mdash;&#8220;That&#8217;s
very true, little man! Your mother
always!&#8221;&mdash;and her lips moved silently&mdash;&#8220;On
earth, and, please God, in
Heaven!&#8221;</p>

<p>Josiah McNason, peering over the garden
gate, now tried to open it, but found it
inflexibly closed against him. He heaved
an involuntary sigh. The Goblin echoed
the sigh derisively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heigh-ho, Beelzebub!&#8221; it said&mdash;&#8220;Good-looking
woman, eh, McNason? And a
pretty boy! That&#8217;s her youngest. She&#8217;s
got three sons and a lovely daughter. Feel
a bit envious, McNason? Don&#8217;t you wish
you hadn&#8217;t jilted her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Josiah started. A sense of fear and
shame began to tingle through his long-chilled
blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is&mdash;she&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; he faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly! That&#8217;s it!&#8221; said the Goblin.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
&#8220;She&mdash;she <span class="allsmcap">IS</span>! The girl whose first affections
you won and threw over! That was
a nasty trick of yours, McNason! You did
it for Money&mdash;yes!&mdash;you&#8217;ve always done
everything for Money! But the girl deserved
a better fate than either <span class="allsmcap">YOU</span> or
your <span class="allsmcap">MONEY</span>!&mdash;and she&#8217;s got it! There she
is&mdash;a beloved woman, wife, and mother.
Just as pretty as you&#8217;re plain! She&#8217;s poor
and you&#8217;re rich. But she&#8217;s contented and
you&#8217;re wretched! She has three sons&mdash;all
clever bright boys,&mdash;and you haven&#8217;t an
heir to your name! You treated her like
a <span class="allsmcap">CAD</span>,&mdash;and she has married a <span class="allsmcap">MAN</span>! He
hasn&#8217;t millions, but he has Heart. Heart
is a curious thing, McNason! You don&#8217;t
know what it is, but it&#8217;s really a curious
thing! It makes Happiness,&mdash;and you
don&#8217;t know what <i>that</i> is either!&#8221;</p>

<p>McNason listened dreamily. All desire to
resent or deny the Goblin&#8217;s accusations had
died out of him. He looked yearningly over
that barred garden gate as an unforgiven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
sinner might look at the closed doors of
Paradise. So that beautiful woman with
the golden-haired boy was Lilias? Lilias
was her name, he remembered;&mdash;he had
called her familiarly by it in the old days,&mdash;days
which he recalled now with a sense
of imminent desolation. Lilias had married
and was happy. Did her happiness please
him? No, he could not say it did. A
bitter jealousy burnt in his soul,&mdash;a wrathful
impatience with Deity. Why was the
future veiled? Why were men left so much
in the dark concerning their destinies?
How could he ever have guessed that Lilias
would have ripened from the timid, pretty,
trusting girl he had known, into this
gracious, lovely, and loving woman with
all the sacred sweetness of home enfolding
her as securely as a rose is enfolded by the
cherishing summer air! And still he looked
at her,&mdash;and still the bitterness in him
grew yet more bitter, and in a kind of
impotent anger he shook the garden gate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
with both his hands, determined to force
it open.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady, McNason!&#8221; said the Goblin
at this juncture&mdash;&#8220;You&#8217;re not master here,
you know! Every man&#8217;s house is his
castle! You want to be a burglar, do
you? So like you! I know a lot of fellows
who feel that way! When they see a man
happier than themselves, with a nice wife
belonging to him, they try to steal the wife
away and make him wretched! It&#8217;s a
fashionable pastime with them, and they
call it &#8216;Souls!&#8217; Oh, Beelzebub! When
they find out what Souls really <i>are</i>, won&#8217;t
they be sorry for themselves! Come along,
McNason!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Josiah clung to the garden gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lilias! Lilias!&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>But Lilias, laughing, was playing with
her boy&#8217;s curls, and neither turned her
head nor raised her eyes. The Goblin
chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think she can hear you, do you?&#8221; it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
inquired mockingly&mdash;&#8220;Oh&mdash;hoo-roo!&mdash;what
a fool you are, McNason! She is as
far away from you as you are from her&mdash;and
that&#8217;s a pretty long distance, I can tell
you! You&#8217;re out in the storm and wind&mdash;she&#8217;s
in the full sunshine! As I told you,
she enjoys a &#8216;spiritual&#8217; climate&mdash;supernatural
weather! But you don&#8217;t believe
in the supernatural, do you, McNason?
Of course not! Why should you! You
don&#8217;t believe in anybody but yourself!
Not even in Me! Oh Beelzebub! Come
along, come along!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221; cried the miserable man,
&#8220;Where in the name of Heaven do you
want to take me next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t talk about Heaven,&#8221;&mdash;said
the Goblin, severely&mdash;&#8220;That&#8217;s a &#8216;supernatural&#8217;
place. I don&#8217;t want to take you
<i>there</i>, you may be sure! It wouldn&#8217;t suit
you at all! Nor me! Come along, come
along! Don&#8217;t hanker any more after what
you have lost and can never find again!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
Sentiment is Stupidity&mdash;Money is Wisdom!
Think of that! It makes you one of the
wisest men on earth! Come! I&#8217;ve got
another old friend waiting to see you&mdash;urgent
appointment! Come along, I tell
you!&#8221; And the Goblin made a vicious
grab at McNason&#8217;s coat-collar. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
<i>yearn</i> like that! You&#8217;re too old to play
Romeo, and ever so much too ugly! Hoo-roo-oo-oo!
One Timothy Two!&mdash;and away
we go!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Out into the storm again on the wings
of the bitter winter wind! All the sunshine
of the &#8220;spiritual&#8221; climate vanished, and a
great panorama of dark clouds moved
rapidly through the freezing air. Clouds
everywhere!&mdash;clouds of fantastic form and
giant shape,&mdash;clouds like rocky fortresses
set on the summits of high mountains,&mdash;clouds
resembling huge ruminative animals
wallowing in ether,&mdash;clouds heavy and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
threatening, suggesting pent-up thunder and
jagged flame! Like a couple of midges the
Goblin and its human victim were tossed
from edge to edge of the thick rolling
vapours, and when they descended to earth
once more, Josiah McNason found himself
in the small &#8220;best parlour&#8221; of an unpretentious
residence,&mdash;one in a row of similar
dwellings in an unpretentious street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your eyes open, McNason!&#8221; said
the Goblin&mdash;&#8220;And your ears! Nobody
sees <span class="allsmcap">YOU</span>, you know, or <span class="allsmcap">ME</span>! We&#8217;re invisible.
And if you want to curse and swear, do so
by all means! Nobody hears, and nobody
cares!&#8221;</p>

<p>Josiah looked, and saw before him a man
reclining in an invalid chair near a small
bright fire, his eyes fixed on the sparkling
flames with a patient and wistful sadness.
A pale, sweet-faced woman with soft brown
hair somewhat silvered, knelt by him, clasping
one of his hands tenderly in her own.
There were traces of tears on her worn thin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
cheeks, and her lips quivered. And standing
close by, with one arm resting on the
mantelpiece, and eyes bent compassionately
down upon the pair, was another man whom
McNason had no difficulty in recognising as
his overseer, Mr. Pitt. Yet his surprise at
this was so great that he could not forbear
an exclamation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pitt here! How the devil&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221; said the Goblin&mdash;&#8220;How the
devil and why the devil! Only the devil
knows!&#8221;</p>

<p>Josiah groaned, and then the overpowering
dumbness that had seized him before
caught him again in its paralysing power.
Stricken mute himself, he was nevertheless
forced to listen with the closest attention
to all that passed around him. And when
Pitt spoke, the sound of that equable familiar
voice sent a new and violent shock
through his already racked nervous system.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. McNason is a man of iron,&#8221;&mdash;said
Pitt&mdash;&#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt about it! In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
fact he&#8217;s harder than any metal, for metal
can be made to melt, and he can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man in the invalid chair moved restlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he remember me at all?&mdash;did you
remind him?&mdash;&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Willie, I did! I even recalled the
days when you used to carry his little son on
your shoulder round to see the works&mdash;and I
said, &#8216;Dove was one of the smartest men in
your employ, and brought valuable custom
to the firm.&#8217; But it was all no use&mdash;no
use!&#8221; He paused and then addressed himself
gently to the woman who knelt by her
husband&#8217;s side. &#8220;I am sure, Mrs. Dove,
you believe that I have done my best?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, indeed, I know you have!&#8221; she
answered earnestly&mdash;&#8220;And,&mdash;after all&mdash;I
never had much hope. Mr. McNason
must have endless claims upon his purse&mdash;and
memory! It is so seldom one finds a
very very rich man who cares to help little
outside troubles like ours&mdash;&#8221; Here her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
voice trembled dangerously, and she
ceased.</p>

<p>Willie Dove sighed a little wearily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah well!&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;I did my best for
him in my day! And I thought he might
possibly be disposed to do me a good turn
now. It&#8217;s true I haven&#8217;t so many years
before me, but I&#8217;ve got some working power
left if I could only get well&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s my fault, Will!&#8221; said his
wife piteously. &#8220;You could, of course, go
to the Hospital and doctors would attend to
you there&mdash;but oh! I couldn&#8217;t bear it!&mdash;I
couldn&#8217;t bear it!&#8221; And here her self-control
gave way, and she began to sob&mdash;&#8220;I
couldn&#8217;t bear to see you taken away from
me after all the years we have spent so
happily together! I couldn&#8217;t bear to think
of you ill, and in a place where I could only
get at you at stated times, with strangers
always about you! It is very foolish of me
and perhaps very wrong&mdash;but I&mdash;I cannot
help it!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>Her husband stroked her bent head with
his thin delicate hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry, Jennie!&#8221; he said softly&mdash;&#8220;I
won&#8217;t go away from you! I&#8217;d rather die!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt coughed obstreperously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Dove,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;Don&#8217;t let
us be miserable on Christmas Eve! I left
McNason himself looking as wretched as a
plucked crow. Poor old chap! With all
his money, I wouldn&#8217;t be in his shoes for the
world! Tell me, what did the doctor say
when he saw you to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About the same as he has always said,&#8221;
replied Dove, resignedly&mdash;&#8220;That an operation
would not only relieve, but cure me,
and that he should like to perform it here in
my own house, and get a good surgical nurse
to attend upon me, with my wife&#8217;s assistance.
For my wife is a capital nurse, aren&#8217;t you,
Jennie?&#8221; He caressed the bent head again
and went on&mdash;&#8220;He thinks me of too nervous
a temperament to do well away from
home.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>There followed a silence. Presently Pitt
spoke again in determined accents.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you what it is, Dove,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;<i>I&#8217;ll</i> lend you the money!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dove started.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i>, Mr. Pitt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I!&#8221; and Pitt, smiling, drew himself
up with an air of resolution&mdash;&#8220;I can&#8217;t
afford it a bit&mdash;but I&#8217;ll risk it! I&#8217;ll risk it
because&mdash;well!&mdash;because it&#8217;s Christmas-time!&mdash;Now
don&#8217;t try to get up!&#8221; for Dove
raising himself in his chair with some difficulty,
caught at Pitt&#8217;s hand and grasped it
hard, while tears stood in his eyes. &#8220;And
don&#8217;t thank me, because I can&#8217;t bear to be
thanked! It&#8217;s Christmas-time, as I&#8217;ve said&mdash;and
I&#8217;ve always had &#8216;old-fashioned&#8217; ideas
of Christmas. My mother taught them to
me&mdash;God bless her!&mdash;I think&#8221;&mdash;and his
voice sank a little&mdash;&#8220;that perhaps we ought
to spare a little &#8216;gold, frankincense and
myrrh&#8217; just at this season&mdash;and this loan to
you will be my thank-offering&mdash;though it&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
a poor thing at best, for you see I can&#8217;t <i>give</i>
you the money, Willie! McNason could
have given it and never have missed it, but
I can&#8217;t. I wish I could! However, if
you&#8217;ll take the will for the deed&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And now Mrs. Dove, rising gently from her
knees, came up to him and laid her hand on
his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;God bless you, Mr. Pitt!&#8221; she said, in
clear sweet tones&mdash;&#8220;He <i>will</i> bless you!&mdash;be
sure of that! What you lend to us is
more than given, because you have such a
friendly sympathy with us, and sympathy
is greater than gold! I will not even try to
thank you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t!&#8221; interrupted Pitt, hastily,
pressing her hand hard&mdash;&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s all
right! Dove and I will arrange our business
matters, and I&#8217;ll see the doctor to-morrow,
even though it <i>is</i> Christmas Day!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pay it all back!&#8221; said Dove, excitedly&mdash;&#8220;I
can work well still&mdash;I&#8217;ve got all
my wits about me&mdash;and I have a fine offer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
from a firm to undertake some affairs for
them immediately if I can only pull up my
strength. And I think I shall manage&mdash;now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pitt here drew a chair to the fire opposite
the sick man and sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a curious thing,&#8221;&mdash;he said&mdash;&#8220;how
the possession of enormous wealth hardens
some people, and makes them not only difficult
to deal with, but often positively cruel
to themselves and to others! Now if one is
to judge by outward looks, Mr. McNason,
though a multi-millionaire, is just about one
of the most miserable men alive!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Goblin chuckled, and gave Josiah a
nudge with its sharp elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear that, McNason!&#8221; it said&mdash;&#8220;It&#8217;ll
do you good to learn what other folks think
of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So old, so feeble and so lonely!&#8221; went on
Mr. Pitt, almost pathetically&mdash;&#8220;When he
refused to do anything for your assistance,
Dove, I was inclined to be very plain-spoken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
and give him a bit of my mind, even at the
risk of offending him,&mdash;but seeing what a
forlorn old wreck he seemed, with his
shrivelled body and wrinkled face, I thought
it was no use being angry with him,&mdash;especially
at Christmas-time! He&#8217;s not long
for this world!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the Goblin nudged Josiah&#8217;s arm
and its fiery eyes glowed with railway-signal
brilliancy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not exactly age that will kill him,&#8221;&mdash;went
on Pitt, meditatively&mdash;&#8220;He&#8217;s not seventy
yet, and ought to look much healthier
and stronger than he does. My father is
eighty-two, and is as well set-up a veteran
as anyone could wish to see&mdash;walks his six
miles a day, and is as young in heart
as a boy&mdash;but of course he has always
lived a very simple life and never hankered
after more money than just as
much as would keep him going and save
him from debt. Mr. McNason has all the
cares of an immense business on his brain&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
naturally a break-down must come
sooner or later&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He ceased. A gust of wind roared down
the chimney, throwing the flames of the
little fire crookedly to and fro. Mrs. Dove
shivered, and looked about her uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a stormy night!&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;Not
at all a peaceful Christmas!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her husband, lying restfully back in his
chair, smiled at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;The peace must be in our hearts,
Jennie!&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;If we don&#8217;t keep
Christmas <i>there</i>, it&#8217;s no Christmas at all!
Storm or calm, it&#8217;s a blessed time!&mdash;a time
of thanksgiving&mdash;a time of hope!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it is,&#8221;&mdash;agreed Pitt&mdash;&#8220;and so may
it always be! Now, Mrs. Dove, bring out
a bottle of that old port your good doctor
sent you the other day, and we&#8217;ll drink to
Willie&#8217;s recovery and health and general
usefulness! And we&#8217;ll wish old McNason a
Merry Christmas, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>They all laughed, and Mrs. Dove set the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
wine and glasses on the table. Mr. Pitt
poured out the ruby-red cordial, and raising
his own glass to his lips said:</p>

<p>&#8220;A Merry Christmas to you, Mrs. Dove!
A Merry Christmas to you, Willie! And to
our grim and gaunt old governor, Mr.
McNason, a Merry Christmas also! And
may he find something better than riches
in the next world and be all the happier
for the finding!&#8221;</p>

<p>They all three drank this toast, and while
they drank, Josiah McNason trembled in
every limb with an ague of exceeding cold.
Was he so near death, he wondered, that
even Pitt could see the near approach of
his end? He turned his miserable eyes
upon the Goblin, who grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother &#8216;Firebrand&#8217; was quite right,
you see!&#8221; it remarked&mdash;&#8220;Soon, very soon,
you will be one of <span class="allsmcap">US</span>! <span class="smcap">We</span> are your &#8216;next
world,&#8217; you know! And riches don&#8217;t count
in our United Empire Club&mdash;but you&#8217;ll be
happy, McNason! Oh yes&mdash;you&#8217;ll be so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
happy! Because you will have reaped the
just reward of your labours, and you will
be exactly what you have made of <span class="allsmcap">YOURSELF</span>!
Nothing could be more satisfactory!
Listen! Willie Dove is talking about you
now!&#8221;</p>

<p>And so he was. Willie Dove was speaking
in the kindest and gentlest way possible
of the man who had refused to help him
in his need.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope Mr. McNason will live
many years yet,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;and that he
will learn how to enjoy and get the best
out of the large fortune he has made. The
amount of good he could do if he liked is
simply incalculable&mdash;and if he would only
use some of his money just for the sole purpose
of benefiting others, and would not
merely put it out like a magnet to draw
more money in again, he would be the
happiest man alive. For instance, if instead
of subscribing large sums to charities which
are presided over by &#8216;committees&#8217; who use<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
up half the money for their own expenses,
he would go himself among the poor and
personally relieve them at first hand,&mdash;if
he would try to help those who are, with
great difficulty, trying to help themselves,&mdash;those
who cannot borrow and will not beg,&mdash;if
he would just put himself out a bit&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s just what he won&#8217;t do!&#8221;
interposed Pitt&mdash;&#8220;He can&#8217;t see anything or
anybody but Himself&mdash;that&#8217;s the pity of
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor soul!&#8221; said Mrs. Dove, gently&mdash;&#8220;We
mustn&#8217;t forget that he lost his only
son,&mdash;a dear little boy!&mdash;and that may
have embittered him. All <i>our</i> children
have been mercifully spared to us, thank
God!&mdash;but even if one had been taken,
I&#8217;m sure we should always have been
thinking of that one! And his &#8216;one&#8217; was
his all! We must remember that! And
however hard he is upon <i>us</i>, we mustn&#8217;t be
hard upon <i>him</i>! That wouldn&#8217;t be keeping
Christmas rightly!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>At this Josiah turned and flung himself
desperately against the Goblin&#8217;s paunch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take me away!&#8221; he muttered, finding
his speech with an effort&mdash;&#8220;Take me out
of this! I&mdash;I don&#8217;t want to stop here!
I want to get away&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">QUICK</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Coals of fire,&#8217; eh?&#8221; said the Goblin&mdash;&#8220;A
trifle scorching, even on a thick skull
like yours, McNason! So you&#8217;d forgotten
Willie Dove, had you? Curious! He was
always a very excellent fellow, though, and
one of the best men in your employ. The
honour of the firm was the first thing with
him at all times, and you owe to his hard
work and straight principles more than you
have the honesty to acknowledge! But it&#8217;s
no use trying to tip the balance of things,
McNason! That balance always rights itself!
Good is good, and evil is evil,&mdash;you
can&#8217;t make one out to be the other, however
much you try! If you&#8217;re spiteful, if you&#8217;re
mean, if you&#8217;re unthankful for the blessings
bestowed on you&mdash;and more than all, if you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
refuse to help those who have helped
<i>you</i>, you are punished! You are, really!
And a good sound flogging you get, I
can tell you! Oh Beelzebub!&mdash;don&#8217;t <i>I</i>
know this! When I was a Churchwarden&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Will</i> you do as I ask you?&#8221; implored
Josiah, desperately, &#8220;Get me out of this!
I want to go home!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor old baby! Wants to go home,
does it!&#8221; jeered the Goblin&mdash;&#8220;Oh, but it
mustn&#8217;t be naughty! It must go where
its nursey takes it! Just another little
ridey-pidey in its coachy-poachy!&#8221; And
rising aloft on its skeleton toes, the Goblin
grew larger and more threatening of aspect,
while its bat-wings, slowly unfurling, seemed
spreading out so darkly and interminably
that Josiah fell on his knees in terror&mdash;&#8220;Just
another taste of the &#8216;supernatural,&#8217;
McNason! Just another little experience
of Hell&#8217;s United Empire Club!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; gasped the trembling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
millionaire&mdash;&#8220;Let me get home! Give me
a chance to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice gurgled away into a faint
tremolo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chance! You&#8217;ve had a thousand
chances!&#8221; retorted the Goblin, scornfully,
&#8220;And you&#8217;ve thrown them all away!
Now you&#8217;re asking for <i>one</i> chance! Oh,
hoo-roo! Come and see how Christians
love one another! With a love that perhaps
you may appreciate, because it is so
like hate! Come and hear an &#8216;ordained&#8217;
clerical Judas deny his Master! <span class="smcap">You</span> and
such men as <span class="allsmcap">YOU</span>&mdash;gorged with gold, and
diseased with Self,&mdash;are chiefly to blame for
the wicked blasphemies which to-day brand
the Christian world with infamy! Come&mdash;come!
Blasphemy will suit you! You have
aided it and abetted it many a time, even
though you <i>are</i> a &#8216;churchwarden.&#8217; Oh,
hoo-roo, hoo-roo! Come in the spirit of
One Timothy Two! Come!&mdash;come!
<span class="smcap">Come!</span>&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>And like a great phantom of black Night
descending, the Goblin swooped upon Josiah
once more;&mdash;the little quiet room,&mdash;where
Willie Dove, his wife and friend were all
cheerily drinking &#8220;A Merry Christmas,&#8221;&mdash;was
blotted from his sight, and again limitless
space enshrouded and enveloped him
in darkness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A muffled and monotonous sound of chanting&mdash;the
twinkling of many bright lights,&mdash;and
the subdued rustling movement of
many people gathered together,&mdash;these were
the next impressions that awakened McNason
to renewed consciousness. He stood in
what seemed a shadowy forest of architecture;&mdash;there
were great marble monuments
all round him inscribed with the names of
famous poets, warriors and historians, and
on one of these the Goblin squatted cross-legged
beside him, blinking with its owl-like
eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>&#8220;There&#8217;s not a seat to be had, McNason!&#8221;
it remarked, with a leer&mdash;&#8220;You must stand!
Oh, Beelzebub! What a thing it is to be a
&#8216;fashionable&#8217; preacher! Nothing &#8216;draws!&#8217;
so well nowadays as an Atheist in Holy
Orders! Not even our reverend brother
&#8216;Firebrand&#8217;! Oh, hoo-roo!&#8221;</p>

<p>McNason looked bewilderedly about him.
Surely he knew the place he was in?&mdash;its
blackened arches, its shadowy aisles were
not wholly unfamiliar? Gradually he recognised
it as that melancholy Valhalla of
English departed greatness, Westminster
Abbey. But why had his uncanny incubus,
&#8220;Professor&#8221; Goblin, brought him hither?
What had he to do with the dense crowd of
people massed round him&mdash;all looking&mdash;all
listening&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>Hush! The monotonous chanting ceased&mdash;there
was a brief pause of pretence at
prayer&mdash;and then a man&#8217;s voice, clear and
incisive, but with a falsetto ring of cold
superciliousness and irony in its tone,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
sounded vibratingly on the silence. The
Church&#8217;s ordained Preacher of the Gospel
began to preach, and Josiah McNason, more
than any other human unit in the congregation,
was compelled to listen. And as he
listened, he became aware that this same
ordained preacher was calmly, but none the
less surely, doing his best to undermine the
very faith of which he was a professed
disciple. Craftily, and with cunningly devised
arguments, which held their meaning
deftly secreted under a veil of choice expressions
and well-turned phrases, he spoke
of &#8220;old&#8221; beliefs with delicate tolerance and
compassion&mdash;throwing in occasional questionings
as to the meaning of &#8220;miracles,&#8221;
and setting down &#8220;Divine&#8221; interposition
as a fable, or rather as a beautiful myth
which in the &#8220;darker&#8221; ages of the world was
eminently useful as a means of intimidating
and chastening the spirits of the ignorant.
He spoke much of a &#8220;New Feeling&#8221; which
was awakening among more advanced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
and civilised human kind,&mdash;that special
&#8220;New Feeling&#8221; which looks upon Man as in
himself supreme, and answerable to no
Higher Tribunal than His Own for his actions.
He deprecated the unfortunately
chaotic state of things in the Churches which
prevented a full inquiry into the foundations
of belief, and hoped that the time was
fast approaching when a larger and broader
view might be obtained, and humanity be
absolved from special duties to a Supernatural
Conception which might possibly
be a mistaken conception after all. In fine,
the drift of his involved and euphuistic eloquence
was to imply that pigmy Man would
in due course be permitted to fathom the
Mind of God,&mdash;and not only be permitted
to fathom it, but to criticize it, question it
and possibly condemn it after the same easy
style, and in the same casual fashion, in
which all human criticism condemns what
it is too limited to comprehend. And
gradually it was forced in upon Josiah<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
McNason&#8217;s not always receptive intelligence
that the rankest heresy, the vilest blasphemy
was being preached from a Christian
pulpit, by one who, passing for a &#8220;Christian&#8221;
minister, was nothing more nor less than a
foul hypocrite, and a disgrace to his sacred
calling. Yet the congregation listened.
They did not rise at once and make a quiet
exit as they should have done, had they
been honest and brave,&mdash;had they truly
loved the Faith which leads to Heaven!
Yet their faces expressed a certain dull
bewilderment,&mdash;some looked worried and
sad&mdash;others perplexed,&mdash;though many of
them appeared indifferent. And certain
words which he had heard often, yet which
he had scarcely heeded while hearing them,
came ringing across McNason&#8217;s mind as
clearly as though they had just been spoken
into his ears:</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">And because iniquity shall abound,
the love of many shall wax cold!</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>He trembled. His eyes were dim,&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
he could still see the Atheist-Preacher&#8217;s
cold, intellectual face,&mdash;he was still in a
vague way conscious that the sermon was
going on, and that a human creature, full
to the very brows of self-sufficiency and
conceit, was presuming to lay down the
law concerning the possible limitations of
the Divine&mdash;a human creature moreover
who occupied his very position in the Church
through having solemnly sworn fidelity to
the Master whom now, by the most covert
subterfuges and sophistries, he was denying,&mdash;and
he was aware that a sense of uneasiness
and discomfort affected nearly all
present, including even himself. He turned
to look at the Goblin,&mdash;but to his amazement
it had disappeared! Was he free
then?&mdash;free once more to go where he liked
and do as he liked?</p>

<p>He tried to move&mdash;but his feet seemed
fastened to the earth with iron weights;
he essayed to speak,&mdash;but his tongue refused
to obey the impulse of his brain. On, still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
on, the voice of the Atheist-Preacher in
England&#8217;s ancient Abbey flowed, with that
equable fluency which comes of long and
careful elocutionary practice, and Josiah
McNason, wedged as he was into the close-pressing
crowd, wondered how long he would
have to stand there, listening to what at
another more convenient time he might very
likely have considered a clever and &#8220;up-to-date&#8221;
exposition of the &#8220;New Feeling.&#8221;
All at once he saw a great Light, like that
of the sun at noonday, suddenly begin to
shine. With glorious effulgence it formed
into a halo of exceeding brilliancy, spreading
from north to south, from east to west of
the old Church, between the Choir and the
Nave, and with a palpitating dread shaking
his very soul, Josiah watched it widening
and ever widening, till taking upon itself
the shape of a Cross, it fired the whole scene
with the radiance of a golden morning!
Yet no one saw it apparently,&mdash;no one save
he, the world&#8217;s great millionaire, who,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
denying the &#8220;supernatural,&#8221; was for the time
under &#8220;supernatural&#8221; sway. And trembling,
he beheld that wondrous Cross move
mysteriously forward, till its light poured
with a gracious beauty and beneficence
over all the dull worn faces of the people&mdash;on
men and women and children alike,&mdash;though,
as it moved, it left the face of the
Atheist-Preacher covered with darkness.
And in the very heart and centre of its environment
lustre, a majestic Figure paced
slowly&mdash;a god-like Man, whose Features
were sorrowful, and whose Brow was crowned
with Thorns. A faint whisper floated on
the air like the sigh of small spirit voices
in plaintive unison:</p>

<p>&#8220;Despised and Rejected! Love, Divine
and Human, Love, Perfect and Eternal!
Despised and Rejected! Even <span class="allsmcap">NOW</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Down, down on his knees fell the man
of many millions, overcome by the most
poignant fear and shame he had ever known.
He had disbelieved! He knew it at last,&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
knew that he had, for the sake of public
conventionality, made mere hypocritical
pretence to worship One Whose sublime
teaching he outraged every day of his life,
Whose commands he ignored, and Whose
example he had never at any time tried to
follow. And now&mdash;now! With pulses
beating as though they would burst, and
eyes dim with painful tears wrung from the
centre of the rocky region of his heart, he
sought to cover his face,&mdash;but was forced
against his will to gaze, half blind and
giddy as he was, on that majestic advancing
Shape, which appeared to draw away all
the shadows of the great cathedral and
transfuse them into light. He noticed, with
an extraordinary anguish, which to him was
as new as it was keen, that the crowded
congregation of people among whom he
knelt seemed totally unaware of the
shining Presence that passed them by,&mdash;and
as that Presence moved slowly and
silently towards the closed doors of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
Abbey, he felt that he must cry out
wildly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look&mdash;look! Kneel down and pray!
Entreat Him not to leave us, for if He goes,
why should we remain!&#8221;</p>

<p>But all utterance was denied him. He
could only watch and tremble. Slowly, very
slowly, with a grand reproach expressed in
every feature of its glorious Countenance,
the heavenly Vision of the Crucified moved
on,&mdash;the doors of the Abbey opened noiselessly,
as though flung aside by invisible
hands, admitting a broad shaft of winter
moonlight from the outer air,&mdash;and so, never
once looking back, it passed out and away
from the crowded church of &#8220;Christian&#8221;
worshippers, and, melting into the silvery
radiance of the moon, disappeared. The
doors closed darkly behind it&mdash;and black
shadows drooped from the dim cathedral
arches, hanging drearily over the people,
and filling the aisles and chapels with a
dull noxious vapour&mdash;and then with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
sudden startling clangour, out rang the Bells
again! The Bells! Hoarse and reproachful!&mdash;full
of menace and foreboding, loneliness
and despair! Such a tolling chime
they gave as might fit the burial of all the
faiths and aspirations of the world! They
spoke of Death, not Life!&mdash;of the black
grave from which all hope of resurrection
had been taken,&mdash;with a sob in their savage
metal throats they proclaimed the closing
of the gates of Heaven!&mdash;with harsh resistance
they bewailed the loss of confidence
in God, of trust in the future, of comfort
in sorrow&mdash;and with dismal and heavy
reverberation they thundered forth &#8220;Death!
Death! Death is the end of all! There
shall be no Hereafter!&#8221;</p>

<p>Within the Abbey the people looked
doubtfully at one another. Some smiled&mdash;some
sighed,&mdash;one or two had tears in their
eyes. A faint whisper ran from lip to lip.
&#8220;Christmas Day!&#8221; they murmured&mdash;&#8220;It
is Christmas Day!&#8221; And again they sighed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
and smiled. But it was evident that the
old Festival for them held no meaning&mdash;no
tender or pious memory. Once perhaps it
might have had&mdash;but now&mdash;! Why now
the very Spirit and Soul of Christmas had
departed!&mdash;the doors of the Christian
Church itself were closed against it,&mdash;the
Divine Friend of Mankind had passed by
unheeded, and had gone away from those
who were passively permitting His honour
to be assailed,&mdash;what then was Christmas
Day but the mere empty name of a discarded
Blessing! The dark shadows steadily
thickened,&mdash;and Josiah, still grovelling on
the ground, with the awful clang of the
moaning Bells in his ears, felt that he was
being stifled and pressed down into a tomb
of everlasting icy cold,&mdash;when he was suddenly
plucked up from his knees by the
grip of a too familiar claw, and lo!&mdash;the
Goblin stood confronting him with a sad
and sober grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dull place, Westminster Abbey!&#8221; it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
remarked&mdash;&#8220;Oh hoo-roo! All damp and
dismals! I wouldn&#8217;t be an England&#8217;s great
man for anything! It&#8217;s the last reward
an England&#8217;s great man ever gets,&mdash;the
&#8216;honour&#8217;&mdash;oh, hoo-roo!&mdash;of being allowed
to moulder among the most mouldered
remains that ever mouldered! Hoo-roo!
I&#8217;m glad the body I used to wear when I
was a Churchwarden is all turned into
daisies in a country churchyard. Pretty
things, daisies! Fancy <i>your</i> old wrinkles
turning into them!&#8221;</p>

<p>McNason was silent. He stood quietly
resigned to the Goblin&#8217;s clutch, waiting for
its next move. And while he waited, he
saw the crowd in front of him sway, part
asunder, and begin to disperse,&mdash;while the
Atheist-Preacher, descending from the pulpit,
held brief conversation with a man
who took from his hand a roll of paper.
McNason could hear him speaking, despite
the space between them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s my sermon in full,&#8221;&mdash;he said&mdash;&#8220;I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
hope you will give it the widest publicity.
The &#8216;copy&#8217; contains a good many
effective bits which I was obliged to leave
out with a mixed congregation. You never
know how people may take the upsetting
of their cherished creeds! In such work
the Press can do more than the Pulpit.
Nothing like a good Press discussion for
shaking the old foundations! And I think
my remarks are likely to cause a fluttering
in the dove-cotes!&#8221;</p>

<p>The reporter&mdash;for such he was&mdash;smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not afraid of your Archbishop?&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>The Atheist-Preacher laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;My Archbishop! He has no time to
give his attention to any such matter as
this. He&#8217;s too busy with the claims of
the Poor Clergy!&#8221;</p>

<p>They both laughed then, shook hands and
separated. McNason, in the Goblin&#8217;s grasp,
watched them go their several ways, and
then suddenly recovering his speech, said:&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>&#8220;That man ought to be put out of the
Church!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right&mdash;so he ought!&#8221; agreed the
Goblin&mdash;&#8220;You are getting quite discriminating,
Josiah! He ought to be put out
of the Church, but who&#8217;s going to do it?
He isn&#8217;t drunk or disorderly! He&#8217;s a liar
and a hypocrite, and he&#8217;s taking his &#8216;salary&#8217;
on false pretences&mdash;but there are hundreds&mdash;perhaps
thousands&mdash;like him! Besides,
those who live in glass houses shouldn&#8217;t
throw stones! You&#8217;re as bad as he is in
your way! You pretend&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>have</i> pretended&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221; said McNason,
humbly.</p>

<p>The Goblin looked at him, and closed
one round eye in a most horrible and
portentous wink.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see!&#8221; it observed&mdash;&#8220;You&#8217;re preparing
to make a good end! You&#8217;re like the
Naughty Duchess! Oh, hoo-roo! What
a character <i>she</i> was! She went the pace
as hard as ever she could till she was quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
worn out and could count her crows-feet,&mdash;then
she began to go to Church regularly,
and became publicly charitable. She turned
herself into a Bazaar Lady; opened several
soup-kitchens, and used to cry over the
newest sweet thing in curates. Naughty,
naughty Duchess! When she died an eminent
Dean preached a sermon about her.
She left him five thousand pounds in her
will. He said she was &#8216;one of the noblest
women that ever lived.&#8217; And she&#8217;s one of
us now. Oh hoo-roo! Don&#8217;t you try to
be like her, McNason!&mdash;it doesn&#8217;t pay!
Come along!&mdash;Come and take a look at
London!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a fantastic caper, the Goblin sidled
and skipped out of the Abbey, its conical
cap glowing like the flame of a will-o&#8217;-the-wisp
in a dark morass,&mdash;while passively,
and without any strength to resist its
imperious lead, the millionaire followed.
In the full radiance of a moon which made
the streets as light as day, they presently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
stood,&mdash;and as in a fevered dream, Josiah
saw the familiar clock-tower of Westminster,
the great square in front of the Houses
of Parliament, and the twinkling lamps on
the bridge that spans the steely gleam of
the river Thames. The dull human roar
of the great metropolis thundered in his
ears like the rushing of many waters, and
while he yet looked on the scene which
he knew so well, the Goblin took off its
cap and touched his eyes with its tasselled
point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tick-tock! Tick-tock! Only two thousand
years by the Spirit&#8217;s clock!&#8221; it said.</p>

<p>And lo!&mdash;the stately tower, buildings
and streets disappeared! Smooth green
fields spread out on every side, full-flowering
with meadow-sweet, buttercups and daisies,&mdash;there
was no longer any bridge across
the river, which, flowing calmly between
low banks of mossy turf and fern, reflected
the sunshine in a thousand sparkles and
plashed against the double shores with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
musical murmurs of peace. A flock of
sheep grazed on the quiet pasture, and
their shepherd sat at his ease by the side
of the placid stream.</p>

<p>And now the Goblin waved its spidery
arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask him,&#8221; it said&mdash;&#8220;what has become
of London!&#8221;</p>

<p>Obediently McNason put the question.
The shepherd turned upon him a young
wondering face.</p>

<p>&#8220;London!&#8221; he echoed. Then he smiled.
&#8220;Oh yes, I think I know what you mean!
There <i>was</i> a city of that name somewhere
about here once, but I don&#8217;t know exactly
where! There&#8217;s nothing of it left now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing!&#8221; exclaimed McNason, aghast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing!&#8221;&mdash;And the Goblin, pronouncing
this word, waved its arms again, whereupon
the Vision vanished,&mdash;&#8220;Nothing!
Not a shred!&mdash;not a brick&mdash;not a bone!
Not even a gold Coin! All the business&mdash;Gone!&mdash;all
the pleasure&mdash;Gone!&mdash;all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
scheming, plotting, lying, cheating, villainy,
hatred and envy of one human creature
contesting with the other&mdash;Gone! All the
self-sufficiency, learning, little wisdom, and
utter godlessness&mdash;Gone! Such will London
be in two thousand years! And Nature
will not miss it! Nature can do without
it very well; Nature can do without you
equally well, McNason! The sun will go
on shining and the birds will go on singing
none the less because You are wanting!
Come along!&mdash;come along! In the spirit
of One Timothy Two, time&#8217;s up! Off we
go on our last journey!&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more Josiah fell on his knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spare me!&#8221; he cried&mdash;&#8220;Spare me!
Surely I have suffered enough!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suffered? You? Oh Beelzebub!&#8221;
And the Goblin began to elongate itself
in its own peculiar and terror-striking style,
&#8220;You&#8217;ve only just begun to know what
it is to <i>feel</i>! You hard old scoundrel!
<i>You</i> talk of suffering!&mdash;why, you have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
lived till over sixty years of age, caring
nothing at all for the troubles of others
unless you could turn such troubles to
your own advantage! As a child you were
selfish,&mdash;as a boy you were selfish,&mdash;as a
young man you were selfish,&mdash;as an old
man you are selfish! You have crushed
out hundreds of human lives in your factories
as if they were mere ants swarming
under your iron heel! You have cut down
the expenses of your business to the narrowest,
meanest, most pitiful margin,&mdash;you
&#8216;sweat&#8217; your labourers to such an extent
that you know you dare not walk through
your own workshops without a revolver in
your pocket and a man on either side of
you for protection&mdash;you are a living curse
to the majority of those you employ&mdash;and
they look for your death in the hope that
after you are gone they will have a kinder
master! And <i>you</i> quote Shakespeare, do
you? And the Bible! Oh hoo-roo! Come
along! Time&#8217;s up, I tell you! And we&#8217;re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
not going far. Just a little see-saw ride
to a Home Sweet Home! A last long
Home! A Happy Home! Oh hoo-roo-oo-oo!
One Timothy Two, and away we
go!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Again a brief spell of semi-consciousness&mdash;a
kind of waking nightmare in which
many confused sights and sounds were
intermingled;&mdash;flying visions of pale worn
faces full of sorrow and appeal; noises
as of weeping, with stifled cries and sobs
of pain;&mdash;and then Josiah McNason opened
his eyes widely, to find himself lying flat
on a narrow bed in the centre of a rather
large room. His head rested on a small,
very hard pillow,&mdash;and on this pillow
squatted the Goblin with an air of being
quite at ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are in a happy &#8216;Home,&#8217;
McNason!&#8221; it chuckled softly in his ear&mdash;&#8220;Don&#8217;t
worry! Don&#8217;t agitate yourself!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
Keep quiet calm! You will have every
possible attention!&#8221;</p>

<p>Josiah stared helplessly about him. He
saw his clothes neatly folded and placed
all together on the top of a chest of drawers,&mdash;his
top-hat was also a particularly conspicuous
object on a chair close by. He
realised that he had been undressed and
put to bed, but how this had happened
he could not tell. He turned a miserable
questioning gaze on the Goblin.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&mdash;what&#8217;s this?&#8221; he stammered&mdash;&#8220;What
are you going to do to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; And the Goblin, with an injured
air of perfect innocence, executed a diabolical
French shrug of its shoulders&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m
not going to do anything to you,
my dear sir! I wouldn&#8217;t be so cruel!
It is <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span>!&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">THEY</span> are going to do something
to you,&mdash;but all for your good!&mdash;oh,
hoo-roo&mdash;all for your good!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They!</span> Who were <span class="allsmcap">THEY</span>? With painful
hesitation Josiah turned his eyes round<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
about again, and presently saw, standing
near him like dim figures in a blurred
photograph, two men talking confidentially
together&mdash;one fairly young, the other
elderly,&mdash;while with them was a smart,
well-set-up, rather perky looking woman
attired in the conventional grey gown,
spotless apron and cap of the &#8220;professional&#8221;
nurse. The elderly man&#8217;s back
was turned, but he seemed to be expounding
some knotty point of argument to his
companions with particular emphasis and
gusto.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something&#8217;s gone wrong with the Works,
McNason!&#8221; said the Goblin, confidentially,
&#8220;That&#8217;s what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Works?&#8221; And McNason&#8217;s troubled
mind immediately reverted to his huge
factories&mdash;&#8220;What works?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Your</span> works!&#8221; and the Goblin leered
at him sideways with a frightful grin&mdash;&#8220;Your
internal works! And these two
learned gentlemen are going to find out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
what it is. You&#8217;re ill, you know!&mdash;you&#8217;re
very ill! The learned gentlemen don&#8217;t
quite understand how or why you&#8217;re ill,
but they&#8217;re going to find out! They&#8217;re
going to slice you up and see what you&#8217;re
like inside! It will be most interesting
and instructive&mdash;to the learned gentlemen!
It won&#8217;t interest <span class="allsmcap">YOU</span> at all, because you&#8217;re
to be put under chloroform, and you won&#8217;t
know anything about it except when you
&#8216;come to.&#8217; Then you will die! But that
won&#8217;t particularly matter! The operation
is sure to be &#8216;most successful.&#8217; An operation
is always &#8216;successful,&#8217; even if the
patient never recovers! The medical profession
must be safeguarded, you know!&#8221;</p>

<p>McNason heard, and in an instant became
a prey to the most violent access of nervous
horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not ill!&#8221; he said fiercely. &#8220;There&#8217;s
nothing whatever the matter with me!
How dare you say there is! It&#8217;s all a mistake&mdash;an
abominable mistake! I&#8217;ve never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
suffered from any illness except gout and
indigestion&mdash;never!&mdash;there&#8217;s no operation
needed for such ailments!&mdash;what the
devil do you mean by bringing me
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>will</i> talk about the devil!&#8221; And
the Goblin shook its tasselled cap at him
reproachfully&mdash;&#8220;Don&#8217;t say I mentioned
him first! You&#8217;re ill, I tell you!&mdash;you&#8217;re
more seriously ill than your old friend Willie
Dove, and you&#8217;re here <i>because</i> you&#8217;re ill!
&#8216;To this complexion must we come at last&#8217;!
Oh Beelzebub! They don&#8217;t know whether
it&#8217;s cancer or appendicitis with <span class="allsmcap">YOU</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here!&#8221; almost shouted Josiah,
addressing himself to the two men, who,
with the nurse, still stood together talking,
but who appeared not to hear him&mdash;&#8220;Take
me out of this place directly! I&#8217;ve been
brought here on false pretences! I&#8217;m not
ill! I don&#8217;t want an operation! I won&#8217;t
be operated upon! I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>Here exhausted, he sank back on his hard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
pillow impotently clenching his hands in a
paroxysm of rage and fear.</p>

<p>The Goblin grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, McNason, keep cool!&#8221; it said&mdash;&#8220;Don&#8217;t
show temper! Doctors don&#8217;t like
that sort of thing. They call it &#8216;nerves&#8217;
and they give you a soothing draught.
Besides, these two eminent personages who
are just now discussing your &#8216;case&#8217; can&#8217;t
hear you, and if they could they wouldn&#8217;t
listen. One&#8217;s a &#8216;Sir.&#8217; He&#8217;s a clever man,
of course, or he wouldn&#8217;t be a &#8216;Sir.&#8217; It&#8217;s
a little unpleasant that the title puts him on
the same rank with any provincial Mayor
who has presented an address to the Sovereign!
But it can&#8217;t be helped. There&#8217;s no
suitable honour in this country for <i>merely</i>
intellectual and scientific persons! Now
about your case&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve <i>no</i> case!&#8221; groaned the wretched
millionaire&mdash;&#8220;No case at all&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> a case!&#8221; declared the Goblin&mdash;&#8220;A
whole case in yourself! A case of a man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
gone wrong! A case of a human creature
who has a stone in the place where his heart
ought to be!&mdash;a hard, heavy stone, without
a pulse of love or kindness in it! A case?
Oh Beelzebub! I should think you <i>are</i> a
case! Sir Slasher Cut-Em-Up&mdash;that&#8217;s the
broad-backed elderly gentleman over there,&mdash;thinks
you&#8217;ve got something &#8216;malignant&#8217;
inside! Oh hoo-roo-oo-oo! I should think
you had! Sir Slasher believes it&#8217;s cancer.
But if it is, they&#8217;ll never find it, McNason!
No!&mdash;<i>your</i> cancer&#8217;s on the mind!&mdash;and
they&#8217;ll never cut <i>that</i> out! But they&#8217;re
going to have a good try!&#8221;</p>

<p>Josiah moaned helplessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Slasher Cut-Em-Up is a great vivisector,&#8221;&mdash;proceeded
the Goblin, cheerfully&mdash;&#8220;He
knows where to find every little nerve
and muscle in the body of a dog, for instance.
I don&#8217;t say your body is at all like that of a
dog!&mdash;I know your Soul isn&#8217;t half so honest
or so faithful! Sir Slasher has had more
than a hundred innocent animals under his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
scalpel&mdash;all poor, trustful, good creatures
whom he has pinned and stretched in every
possible position on his rack of torture&mdash;whose
nerves he has severed&mdash;whose muscles
he has galvanized&mdash;and whom he has killed
as slowly, as ruthlessly and as criminally as
any Torquemada that ever roasted a heretic
to the sound of sacred music! Hoo-roo!
Sir Slasher knows a thing or two, I can tell
you! He&#8217;s a licensed murderer of the harmless
and helpless,&mdash;but even a dog&#8217;s soul has
a place in the eternal countings, as Sir
Slasher may find out to his cost when he
becomes a member of our United Empire
Club! He cut up a dog yesterday&mdash;now
he&#8217;s going to cut up <span class="allsmcap">YOU</span>! You&#8217;re a splendid
subject for him, you know! You&#8217;ve
got so much <span class="allsmcap">MONEY</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Josiah moaned in a stupor of fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got so much <span class="allsmcap">MONEY</span>!&#8221; repeated
the Goblin, smacking its wide lips as though
it were tasting something savoury,&mdash;&#8220;And
<span class="allsmcap">MONEY</span>&#8217;s a great thing! <span class="smcap">Money</span> has enabled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
you to come to this &#8216;Home&#8217;&mdash;one of the most
select &#8216;Homes&#8217; in London! Oh, Home
Sweet Home! Oh happy, happy Home!
It&#8217;s the special pet &#8216;Nursing Home&#8217; of Sir
Slasher Cut-Em-Up, where he&#8217;s got the
matron and all the nurses under his big
Thumb! Oh, hoo-roo! Such a dear Home!
You pay Five Guineas a week for your room
to begin with,&mdash;and then when you&#8217;re very
ill, you pay Ten. Afterwards, when you
get worse and are likely to die, you pay
Fifteen. The nurse is extra. If you have
two nurses you have two extras. Everything
apart from the room and the bed is
&#8216;extra.&#8217; If you want a bottle of soda water
you pay sixpence for a &#8216;split,&#8217; ninepence for
a full. And so on! And so on! Oh,
what a dear &#8216;comfy&#8217; Home! There aren&#8217;t
many like it in London, I can tell you!
Only a few&mdash;a beautiful, blessed few!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment, the personage whom the
Goblin designated as Sir Slasher-Cut-Em-Up
finished his conversation with his younger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
colleague, and both gentlemen smiled pleasantly,
not to say flirtatiously, at the grey-gowned
nurse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twelve o&#8217;clock to-morrow will do very
well,&#8221; said Sir Slasher&mdash;&#8220;We shall leave
you to make all the preliminary arrangements,
Nurse Drat-Em-All. He&#8217;s asleep
just now, I see!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not asleep!&#8221;&mdash;gurgled McNason,
feebly.</p>

<p>But Sir Slasher apparently did not hear.
He stood by the bedside, smiling blandly,
his hands clasped behind him under his
coat-tails.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the richest men in the world!&#8221;
he ejaculated, appreciatively&mdash;&#8220;Dear me,
dear me! Ah well, well! Has he any
family?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None,&#8221;&mdash;said Nurse Drat-Em-All&mdash;&#8220;He
had one son, I believe, who died in childhood.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke primly, her lips opening and shutting
on her words like a kind of mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
valve. But while she spoke she flashed
her eyes at the younger doctor with a feline
cajolery in their hard brown depths.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then who,&#8221; murmured Sir Slasher,
thoughtfully&mdash;&#8220;Who is to carry on his vast
business concerns? Who is to inherit his
enormous fortune?&#8221;</p>

<p>No answer was forthcoming to this profound
proposition.</p>

<p>Sir Slasher thereupon removed his hands
from under his coat-tails, and consulted his
watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must be going,&#8221;&mdash;he said&mdash;&#8220;You will
attend to all that is necessary, Nurse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Sir Slasher!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall bring Dr. Choke-Em-Off with me
to-morrow&mdash;and I think&mdash;yes, I think&#8221;&mdash;here
he looked benevolently considerate&mdash;&#8220;that
taking into account Mr. McNason&#8217;s
great wealth and important position, and&mdash;er&mdash;also&mdash;er&mdash;the
very great difficulty and
uncertainty of the operation, Dr. Choke-Em-Off&#8217;s
fee should be doubled! He is one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
our best an&aelig;sthetists&mdash;what do you say,
Nurse?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Slasher had a delightful smile, and
he was smiling delightfully now. Nurse
Drat-Em-All responded to the charm of
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no doubt that it is justifiably
a case of double fees all round!&#8221; she said,
her own smile breaking into a giggle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221; And Sir Slasher shed a
fatherly glance upon her&mdash;&#8220;And our young
friend here&#8221;&mdash;at this he laid a hand on his
fellow-surgeon&#8217;s shoulder&mdash;&#8220;Our young and
brilliant friend will also have an opportunity
of displaying his skill and securing his reward!
Of course,&#8221;&mdash;here he became portentously
business-like&mdash;&#8220;it will be advisable
to get the patient to sign the required
cheques in advance,&mdash;there will be no difficulty
about that I should imagine! Because
you see,&mdash;afterwards!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&mdash;afterwards!&#8221; echoed the younger
doctor, speaking for the first time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>Sir Slasher tried to look grave, but failed
in the attempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Afterwards,&#8221; he said pleasantly,&mdash;&#8220;the
worthy millionaire may not be in a condition
to sign anything! I think&#8221;&mdash;and he
paused, stroking his smooth double chin&mdash;&#8220;I
think, Nurse, he should be told that the
operation is a grave, very grave one, in
case&mdash;these things sometimes happen!&mdash;in
case he has not made a will&mdash;or&mdash;let us say
in case he might wish to make some last
testamentary gift&mdash;to&mdash;er&mdash;to me?&mdash;or&mdash;or
to you?&mdash;or to anyone else who may
have rendered him a service?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see that he does all that he ought to
do!&#8221; said Nurse Drat-Em-All, with some
severity&mdash;&#8220;I like my patients to be prepared
for the worst!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right&mdash;quite right!&#8221; murmured
Sir Slasher&mdash;&#8220;But prepare him gently&mdash;quite
gently, Nurse! By degrees&mdash;and
cautiously! I <i>have</i> known cases where
patients, getting too much alarmed, have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
made their escape from a home like this by
jumping out of the window! And strange
to say they have&mdash;some of them&mdash;escaped
uninjured!&mdash;and stranger still, they have
recovered and lived many years! Most
curious and remarkable! But nerves are
unaccountable things!&#8221; Here he paused
and looked again at McNason. &#8220;He sleeps
very soundly! I should say he was older
than he admits! Ah well, well! We shall
see! But I very much fear there&#8217;s no chance
for his recovery!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why not spare the knife and let
him live as long as Nature will allow him?&#8221;
asked the younger doctor suddenly.</p>

<p>Sir Slasher looked amazed and reproachful.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear sir! I was called in by Mr.
McNason, and I must do my best for such
a very wealthy man! Besides, I think his
is a very complex case, and likely to prove
most helpful and instructive. To-morrow
at twelve o&#8217;clock, Nurse! Good-evening!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>And Sir Slasher Cut-Em-Up walked softly
out of the room, followed by his colleague.
Nurse Drat-Em-All, with a casual glance at
the bed where Josiah McNason lay, settled
her cap more coquettishly on her head and
tripped after them.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re gone!&#8221; said the Goblin then,
sliding down from the pillow and sitting
astride on Josiah&#8217;s recumbent body&mdash;&#8220;But
Nurse Drat-Em-All will soon be back!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want her back!&#8221; groaned
McNason, making an attempt to draw up
the bed-quilt in order to cover his eyes, in
which effort he did not succeed&mdash;&#8220;I don&#8217;t
want anything! Leave me alone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry I can&#8217;t oblige you!&#8221; replied the
Goblin&mdash;&#8220;I can&#8217;t leave you alone till you
leave <span class="allsmcap">YOURSELF</span> alone! And Nurse Drat-Em-All
must come back to attend to her
duties! She&#8217;s got a lot of things to do to
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>McNason peered over the extreme edge
of the bed-quilt.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>&#8220;A lot of things to do to me?&#8221; he
echoed, whimperingly&mdash;&#8220;What&mdash;what will
she do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will wash you first!&#8221; said the
Goblin, briskly&mdash;&#8220;All over! Oh, such a
nice wash! Made of carbolic disinfectant!
And you will be so clean&mdash;<i>outside</i> you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Josiah closed his eyes shudderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then you will be put into a new
flannel night-shirt,&#8221;&mdash;went on the Goblin&mdash;&#8220;And
you will perhaps be allowed a cup
of hot milk or beef tea. And when you&#8217;re
nice and warm and clean and cosy, Nurse
Drat-Em-All will come and tell you to
prepare for your end!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no!&#8221; cried McNason&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m not
ill!&mdash;and I&#8217;m not ready&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> ill!&#8221; declared the Goblin,
firmly&mdash;&#8220;And never mind about not being
ready for your end. Nurse Drat-Em-All
will <i>make</i> you ready! She&#8217;ll tell you what
a very serious and expensive matter it will
be to slice you up scientifically to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>&mdash;and
she will ask you where your cheque
book is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t tell her&mdash;I won&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221; stuttered
McNason.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, you will! <i>She&#8217;ll</i> get it out of
you! And then you&#8217;ll write a big cheque
for Sir Slasher Cut-Em-Up, and another for
the matron of this happy &#8216;Home&#8217;&mdash;and
for Dr. Choke-Em-Off,&mdash;and for everybody
else who wants a fee for sending you into
the next world&mdash;and then&mdash;then you&#8217;ll be
allowed to sleep if you can! And to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the Goblin paused. Josiah raised
himself up on his hard pillow and looked
at it with appealing eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so very long ago,&#8221;&mdash;it went on
presently, in a kind of sing-song monotone,
&#8220;A man I knew went to a &#8216;Home&#8217;
something like this, only not quite so up-to-date
and expensive. He was a bold,
kindly, genial creature, fond of life and
life&#8217;s pleasures. Something went wrong<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
with him and he consulted the doctors.
They told him he had an internal ailment,
but they could not tell whether it was
&#8216;malignant&#8217; or not, till they had, so to
speak, &#8216;opened him up.&#8217; He felt strong and
hopeful, and consented to the operation.
The surgeons did their work&mdash;and how they
did it, of course, only they can tell. But
it was, according to their own report, &#8216;successful.&#8217;
In forty-eight hours the warm-blooded
personality of the man that had
talked, smiled and jested with his own
danger, was a mere lump of cold, stiff clay.
He had relatives&mdash;oh yes!&mdash;he had children
for whom he had worked all his life. What
did they do? Why, they allowed his body
which had so lately pulsated with love for
them all, to be taken away from the &#8216;home&#8217;
in which he died, and laid in a dismal vault
without a single soul to keep watch by it
at night or say a prayer! The world is
growing callous concerning the dead, you
know! And they don&#8217;t keep corpses in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
&#8216;Homes.&#8217; When a man dies under an
operation he must be &#8216;removed&#8217; by his
family at once. In this case the poor
fellow was &#8216;removed&#8217; to a chill city mortuary.
His children, warm and comfortable,
ate food as usual and discussed the funeral
business. Down in the cold and darkness
lay the once animated, cheery, generous-hearted
man, alone&mdash;all, all, alone!&mdash;shut
out from the movement and light of natural
things, with no loving eyes to keep watch
by his mortal remains,&mdash;no tender hands
to lay flowers on his lifeless breast!&mdash;and
yet sentimentalists talk about family love
and home-affections! Oh hoo-roo!&#8221; And
the Goblin actually had tears like sparks of
fiery dew in its eyes&mdash;&#8220;You ought to be
glad you&#8217;ve got no children, McNason!
You&#8217;ve got <span class="allsmcap">MONEY</span> instead! And <span class="allsmcap">MONEY</span>
will enable you to have your body carried
home grandly to your country seat by
special train! You can be laid out in state
if you like!&mdash;provided you give the order<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
before Sir Slasher Cut-Em-Up arrives to-morrow&mdash;candles
burning all round you and
wreaths on your coffin,&mdash;it&#8217;s all done for
<span class="allsmcap">MONEY</span>!&mdash;and you can have a most expensive
funeral,&mdash;a beautiful mausoleum,&mdash;a
marble monument and a lying Epitaph!
All for <span class="allsmcap">MONEY</span>! <span class="smcap">Money&#8217;s</span> a great thing,
McNason!&mdash;and you&#8217;ve got it! Oh Beelzebub!
You&#8217;ve got it! But you&#8217;ve got
nothing else!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this juncture McNason suddenly sat
up in bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have!&#8221; he said, with a kind of
trembling eagerness&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ve got something
else! I&#8217;ve got <span class="allsmcap">YOU</span>! And I want&mdash;I want
to make a friend of <span class="allsmcap">YOU</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Goblin opened its round eyes so wide
that they threatened to fall out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you do, do you?&#8221; it queried
doubtfully&mdash;&#8220;That&#8217;s odd! Now what put
that into your head?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;I don&#8217;t know!&#8221; stammered
McNason agitatedly&mdash;&#8220;But I think&mdash;&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
feel&mdash;&mdash;you don&#8217;t really want to do
me any harm! Look here!&mdash;Get me out
of this! Take me away&mdash;take me away&mdash;take
me home!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Goblin took off its conical cap and
examined the interior of that head gear
with critical gravity. Its hair, in the all-round
style, seemed blacker and stickier
than ever, and its features worked into the
most alarming contortions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take you home!&#8221; it echoed&mdash;&#8220;What!
Before Nurse Drat-Em-All comes back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;yes!&#8221; and Josiah wrung his
hands imploringly; &#8220;Take me away at
once&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re ill!&#8221; said the Goblin&mdash;&#8220;You&#8217;re
very ill!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You <span class="allsmcap">ARE</span>! You&#8217;ve got a cancer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You <span class="allsmcap">HAVE</span>! It&#8217;s called Selfishness!
It is eating your life away,&mdash;poisoning your
blood&mdash;rotting your Soul!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get rid of it!&mdash;I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll cut it out
myself!&#8221;&mdash;and in his excitement McNason
caught hold of the Goblin&#8217;s claw and pressed
it fervently&mdash;&#8220;I will&mdash;I will! Only take
me out of this! Give me a chance!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re feverish too!&#8221; continued the
Goblin, severely. &#8220;Your temperature has
gone up to the very highest point of
Fraudulent Philanthropy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know&mdash;I know!&mdash;but it will be all
right!&mdash;only let me get home, and you
shall see&mdash;you shall see&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>Here his voice ebbed away into a kind
of choked sob.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m not sure that you haven&#8217;t got
eczema,&#8221;&mdash;pursued the Goblin&mdash;&#8220;Your
snobbish hankering after a Peerage will
probably break out in a rash all over you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t!&#8221; said McNason&mdash;&#8220;It shan&#8217;t!
I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll do whatever you tell me&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, will you really though!&#8221; And the
Goblin sniffed the air with its terribly
plastic nose very dubiously&mdash;&#8220;Do you mean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
it? Or is it all funk? And only because
you want to get away from Sir Slasher
Cut-Em-Up? I don&#8217;t believe in death-bed
repentances!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not&mdash;it&#8217;s not a death-bed repentance!&#8221;
wailed McNason&mdash;&#8220;I don&#8217;t want
this to be my death-bed! I want to die
in my own home!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! So does Willie Dove!&#8221; said the
Goblin. &#8220;Perhaps you can understand now
why his wife doesn&#8217;t want to send him to
a Hospital!&#8221;</p>

<p>McNason shuddered. Time was flying
fast, he thought&mdash;that cruel-looking Nurse
Drat-Em-All would be coming back immediately!&mdash;and
with an imploring cry he
held out his arms to the Goblin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, be good to me!&#8221; he moaned&mdash;&#8220;Take
me home! I&#8217;ll promise anything&mdash;anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to promise,&#8221;&mdash;said the Goblin,
&#8220;Anyone can do that! But will you
keep your promises? For instance, will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
you think of some other few things besides
<span class="allsmcap">YOURSELF</span>?&#8221;</p>

<p>McNason lifted his trembling hands in the
fashion of one invoking the gods.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will!&mdash;I will!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a Man of <span class="smcap">Money</span>,&#8221;&mdash;pursued
the Goblin&mdash;&#8220;And with all the <span class="allsmcap">MONEY</span> you
possess will you think of <span class="allsmcap">POVERTY</span>? Of the
thousands and thousands of human beings
made of the same flesh and blood as yourself,
who perish every year for lack of
food? Of infants starving? Of patient
genius, toiling for mere pence? Of delicate
women working their lives away in order
to provide sustenance for their children?
Will you think of all these, and help them
when you can?&mdash;not grudgingly, nor patronisingly,&mdash;but
with a full heart and a
generous spirit?&#8221;</p>

<p>Faintly as a bride at the altar, McNason
murmured &#8220;I will!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a Man of Luxury,&#8221;&mdash;went on
the Goblin&mdash;&#8220;Will you think of <span class="allsmcap">CRIME</span>?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
Of the woeful sins which wretched men are
driven to commit through want and misery?
Of the prisons, crowded with branded human
creatures, who in nine cases out of ten
owe their guilt to the evil persuasions of
others more cunning, more treacherous and
powerful than themselves! Of unhappy
mothers, gone mad with despair, who have
murdered their children rather than see
them die of hunger! Of girls, once innocent,&mdash;betrayed,
ruined and deserted by
the villainy and cruelty of such devils in
the shape of men that even Hell might
close its doors against them! Will you
think of <span class="allsmcap">CRIME</span>?&mdash;and, thinking of it, will
you remember that it is often the sight of
a man like <span class="allsmcap">YOU</span>,&mdash;over-prosperous, over-proud,&mdash;that
helps to drive the poor into
the labyrinths of envy, hatred, drink,
murder and suicide! Will you think of
<span class="allsmcap">CRIME</span>?&mdash;and do your best to fight against
it with all your influence, all your power
and all your <span class="allsmcap">MONEY</span>?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>And at this juncture the Goblin looked
positively terrific. McNason quailed before
its Gorgon eyes, and shivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I will try!&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>The Goblin rose on its skeleton toes and
lifted its skeleton arms. Its voice grew
loud and shrill.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a Man of Commerce and
Calculation,&#8221;&mdash;it said&mdash;&#8220;Will you think of
<span class="allsmcap">WAR</span>! Think of nation rising against nation
and kingdom against kingdom! The beginning
of sorrows! Think of widows and
orphans!&mdash;think of thousands of dying and
dead men! Of human blood springing hot
to heaven and clamouring for vengeance!
Of burning cities and wrecked ships!
Hark! Listen to the rush of waters and
the roll of guns!&#8221;</p>

<p>And now, as the Goblin spoke, there came
a distant booming sound upon the air,
mingled with the measured tramp of many
marching feet, and hundreds of male voices
strongly uplifted in defiant chorus:</p>

<p>&#8220;War!&#8221; said the Goblin, tossing its
arms wildly as the sounds died away,&mdash;&#8220;War!
Accursed, yet triumphant War!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
Think of it, <span class="allsmcap">YOU</span>, with your millions! <i>Can</i>
you, <i>will</i> you think of it without <span class="allsmcap">SPECULATING</span>
in the wide-spread misery it involves?
Without making more <span class="allsmcap">MONEY</span> on the traffic
in blood? Without lending yourself and
your wealth to wicked Contracts by which
you steal from your Country&#8217;s government
and line your own pockets? <i>Can</i> you be

assistance for your own personal advantage
to your Country&#8217;s foes?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lashed into a fit of nervous desperation
McNason almost shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can! I can! And I will!&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon the Goblin put on its conical
cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are coming round, McNason!&#8221;
it observed encouragingly&mdash;&#8220;You are really
coming round! I think you are better!
Your temperature is lower&mdash;nearer the
normal Principle! Principle is an excellent
pulse&mdash;it&#8217;s firm and steady, and keeps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
the whole body going wholesomely! Very
few have it nowadays, and as a natural consequence
the statistics of insane and diseased
persons show an alarming increase! Now,&#8221;&mdash;this
with an oblique but not unfriendly
leer&mdash;&#8220;Are you sure you feel well enough to
go home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure&mdash;sure!&#8221;&mdash;and Josiah began
to scramble out of bed in his excitement&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ll
get my clothes on in a
minute&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you wait for Nurse Drat-Em-All?&#8221;
suggested the Goblin with a chuckle,
&#8220;She&#8217;ll be back directly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">NO</span>!&#8221; Here his voice faltered
and died away as he discovered to his terror
that he had no power to put his feet to the
floor, nor could he reach his clothes. &#8220;Oh,
I am so helpless!&#8221; he wailed&mdash;&#8220;So feeble
and helpless! Oh dear, oh dear! What
shall I do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a split soda!&#8221; said the Goblin&mdash;&#8220;In
this dear sweet &#8216;Home&#8217; it&#8217;s only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
sixpence! But if you put a B in it, it&#8217;s
two shillings!&#8221;</p>

<p>Half mad with impatience, Josiah wriggled
about in the bed, turning his imploring
eyes on the relentless Goblin, who, perched
on the quilt, was beginning to elongate
itself in the most leisurely manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you want to keep Christmas
now!&#8221; it remarked presently&mdash;&#8220;And you&#8217;re
in a hurry to begin. Is that it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;yes, that&#8217;s it!&#8221; stuttered Josiah,
&#8220;You&#8217;ll take me, won&#8217;t you&mdash;you&#8217;ll take
me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Goblin waved its claw. And in
another instant Josiah McNason stood erect,
fully clothed, gazing fearfully up&mdash;up, ever
so high at the indescribable face and form
which now loomed like a monstrous bat
above him. So tall had it suddenly grown
and so thin,&mdash;so terrible were its goggle
eyes,&mdash;so enigmatical its wide grin, that
anxious as he was to depart from his present
place of torture, he shook like a leaf in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
stiff breeze at the prospect of another
&#8220;airship&#8221; voyage with such a fearsome
skipper of the winds.</p>

<p>&#8220;One Timothy Two!&#8221; said the Goblin,&mdash;and
its voice seemed to fall from some
magic pinnacle reared miles above the
clouds&mdash;&#8220;One Timothy Two! Grace,
Mercy, Peace! Time to keep Christmas!
Christmas Day and Christmas Bells! Come
along! Come along! Home for the holidays!
Off we go!&#8221;</p>

<p>Stooping forward like a giant Cloud from
the sky, the Goblin whisked off the shrinking,
shuddering millionaire as easily as a
gust of wind whisks off the broken branch
of a tree, and spreading its great wings,
whirled with a wild &#8220;Hoo-roo-oo-oo!&#8221; out
into the starry spaces of the night.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now came soft pauses of silence,&mdash;flashing
gleams of colour like broken rainbows
floating at will through the pure ether,&mdash;glimpses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
of clear sky wherein the greater
planets shone gloriously, resembling revolving
lights set in the watch-towers of Heaven,&mdash;straying
films of pearly vapour through
which the moon peered fitfully with a
doubtful brilliancy&mdash;then lo! the dear
familiar Earth, lifting its dark rim against
the pale blue reaches of the morning&mdash;and
then the Sun! Warm with its golden
heart&#8217;s effulgence, the splendid Orb of life
and health and beauty rose in a flood of
glory over the mountain-tops and over the
seas,&mdash;spreading radiance on the wintry
fields,&mdash;illumining the leafless trees,&mdash;and
deepening to a more vivid scarlet the
berries of the thick green holly, and the
dainty feathers on the breasts of the robins.
And the Bells!&mdash;oh, the Bells! How they
rang!&mdash;how they sang in all the turrets
and steeples of every church that lifted its
shining spire to the sunshine! &#8220;Peace&mdash;Good&mdash;will&mdash;!
Peace&mdash;Good&mdash;will!&#8221; they
seemed to say over and over again with such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
a gladness and a thankfulness in their soft
chiming as made the heart grow full of tenderness
and tears! And now, all suddenly,
a tremulous little chorus of small fresh
voices began to mingle with the Bells&#8217;
sweet tune&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;God rest you, merry gentlemen!</div>
<div class="indent">Let nothing you dismay!</div>
<div class="verse">Remember Christ our Saviour</div>
<div class="indent">Was born on Christmas Day!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then came a pause,&mdash;a murmur&mdash;and
again the quaint old melody began&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;God rest you, merry gentlemen!</div>
<div class="indent">Let nothing you dismay!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Uttering a smothered cry, Josiah McNason
started to his feet. What&mdash;what was this?
Where was he? Wildly he stared about
him&mdash;and then with a kind of hysterical
shout, recognised his surroundings.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m at home!&#8221; he cried&mdash;&#8220;At home!
In my own house! In my own room!
Thank God!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>Pressing his hands to his forehead he
gazed bewilderedly at every familiar object.
There was his desk&mdash;his armchair,&mdash;(he
seemed to have just sprung out of that
chair)&mdash;the fireplace, where now there was
no fire but only a heap of white ashes in
the grate&mdash;the telephone&mdash;ah, that telephone!&mdash;his
papers, books, letters, ink,
pens&mdash;ledgers&mdash;and a cheque-book,... On
this last object his eyes rested meditatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a dream!&#8221; he muttered&mdash;&#8220;A
horrible, horrible dream! Nothing else!
It was a Dream!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It <span class="allsmcap">WASN&#8217;T</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer came sharply and with remarkable
emphasis.</p>

<p>Josiah trembled violently. He was not
yet alone then? A sudden thought struck
him, and a light came into his eyes&mdash;a
light new and strange, that gave them quite
a youthful sparkle.</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate,&#8221;&mdash;he said&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ll be before
Pitt this time! I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll cut him out!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>And sitting down at his desk, he drew
pen and paper to his aid, and wrote the
following&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;My dear Sir,&mdash;I am exceedingly sorry
to hear of your precarious condition of
health, especially when I recall the strength
and activity which used to distinguish you
so greatly at one time when you did such
excellent work for the firm. I understand
from my overseer, Mr. Pitt, that a couple
of hundred pounds will be useful to you
at this particular juncture, and I have
much pleasure in enclosing you a cheque
for that amount as a slight testimony of
my great appreciation of your former
faithful services. Trusting you will pull
through your illness, and assuring you of the
great satisfaction it gives me to be of assistance
to you in a time of need, believe me,
with best wishes for a pleasant Christmas,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">&#8220;Yours obliged and sincerely.</span><br />

&#8220;<span class="smcap">Josiah McNason</span>.&#8221;</p></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>Taking his cheque-book, he wrote the
required formula, that Two Hundred Pounds
(200<i>l.</i>) should be paid to William Dove
&#8220;or order,&#8221; and signed his name &#8220;Josiah
McNason&#8221; with a free proud dash under
the signature that made it even more
characteristic than usual. Putting letter
and cheque in an envelope, he sealed and
addressed it to &#8220;William Dove, Esq.,&#8221; and
enclosed the whole packet in another envelope
with a few words addressed to Mr.
Pitt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221;&mdash;he said then, with a bland,
almost smiling air&mdash;&#8220;that will do for Mr.
Pitt! Mr. Pitt will find himself out of
court this time!&#8221;</p>

<p>He got up from his desk and stood
irresolute. Then he rang his bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;This must be taken by special messenger,&#8221;&mdash;he
said&mdash;&#8220;There&#8217;s no late post
on Christmas Day!&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled, and rubbed his hands. At
that instant the door opened, and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
servant Towler appeared, with a pale,
rather scared face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Towler!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, sir! Glad to see you
well, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to see me well! Have I been
ill, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir I&mdash;at least I hope not, sir!
But I went to call you at seven o&#8217;clock,
as you told me, sir, and you weren&#8217;t in
your room, and your bed hadn&#8217;t been
slept in&mdash;and&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;didn&#8217;t know what
to think, sir! I didn&#8217;t dare to come in
here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was busy,&#8221;&mdash;said Josiah, calmly&mdash;&#8220;Very
busy!&mdash;tremendously busy all night!
What time is it now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nine o&#8217;clock, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s Christmas Day, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yessir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a sovereign for you,&#8221;&mdash;and
McNason handed that coin to his astonished
retainer&mdash;&#8220;And just get someone to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
take this letter to Mr. Pitt&#8217;s house at once.
It&#8217;s important.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yessir! Certainly, sir! Thank-you,
sir! A Merry Christmas to you, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank-you! Same to you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Backing deferentially out of his master&#8217;s
presence, Towler ran downstairs as fast as
he could into the servants&#8217; hall, there
announcing that &#8220;Something&#8217;s happened to
the Governor! He&#8217;s too pleasant to last!&#8221;</p>

<p>And McNason, still standing thoughtfully
by his desk, repeated again in an undertone:</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a Dream! It must have been
a Dream!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It <span class="allsmcap">WASN&#8217;T</span>!&#8221; And a shrill falsetto
voice rang clear on the silence. &#8220;Hoo-roo&mdash;oo&mdash;oo!
Don&#8217;t you dare to call <span class="allsmcap">ME</span>
a Dream!&#8221;</p>

<p>And with a violent shock of renewed
terror McNason saw, poised between him
and the sunlight which poured through
the windows, the Goblin, shrunk in size
to the smallest quaintest creature possible,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
holding over its strangely shaped head a
sprig of holly, exactly as a man holds an
open umbrella.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going!&#8221; it said&mdash;&#8220;But don&#8217;t you
be such a fool as to think yourself a Something
and me a Nothing! You&#8217;ll make
an awful mistake if you do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry!&#8221; said McNason, humbly&mdash;&#8220;I
don&#8217;t want to make any more mistakes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better not!&#8221; said the Goblin,
and its form began to grow more vague
and indistinct&mdash;&#8220;You&#8217;ve got the chance
you asked for&mdash;but if you lose it now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What you would like to think was only
a Dream, is a Supernatural Reality!&#8221;
went on the Goblin; &#8220;It has all happened,
or it <i>will</i> happen if you don&#8217;t take care!
If your mind breeds disease, so will your
body,&mdash;and Sir Slasher will have to be
called in! And if he&#8217;s once called in,
<span class="allsmcap">YOU</span> will be called <span class="allsmcap">OUT</span>!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>McNason shuddered,&mdash;but was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve begun to keep Christmas in the
proper way for the first time in your life,&#8221;&mdash;and
the Goblin&#8217;s voice grew fainter and
fainter&mdash;&#8220;But if you don&#8217;t go on keeping
it!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will!&#8221; cried Josiah, eagerly&mdash;&#8220;I
will!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the spirit of One Timothy
Two?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grace&mdash;mercy&mdash;peace!&#8221;</p>

<p>The words floated on the air like a breath&mdash;and
then, the Goblin turned its back and
began to trot slowly away under its holly
sunshade. Smaller and smaller it grew,
till it looked no bigger than a tiny Christmas
doll on a Christmas tree. And then all at
once a shining tangle of golden curls and a
glitter of sparkling eyes flashed against the
window&mdash;a semi-circle of children pressed
their round rosy faces close to the panes,
and again began to sing:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;God rest you, merry Gentlemen!</div>
<div class="indent">Let nothing you dismay!</div>
<div class="verse">Remember Christ our Saviour</div>
<div class="indent">Was born on Christmas Day!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Whereat the great Josiah McNason, multi-millionaire,
laughed,&mdash;actually laughed!
Going to the window he threw it open, and
putting a hand into his pocket, he took
out a bunch of silver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, youngsters!&#8221; he cried&mdash;&#8220;Christmas
morning, eh? Here you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>Out flew threepences, sixpences and
shillings in a shower.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fair play!&#8221; he exclaimed&mdash;&#8220;Equal
profits! Don&#8217;t trample one on the other!
Girls first, boys next! The strong must
help the weak! That&#8217;s right!&mdash;all good
friends together&mdash;all happy! No envy, no
jealousy,&mdash;all peace and goodwill! A Merry
Christmas!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!&#8221;
shouted the astonished children, as, jumping
for joy, they gathered up their gifts.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>&#8220;Merry Christmas!&#8221; lisped a small boy
with a flaxen head, sturdily clambering up
to the window from the lawn a couple of
feet below, and looking boldly in the face of
the world&#8217;s celebrated Rich Man;&mdash;&#8220;God
Bless You!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the Rich Man answered gently:</p>

<p>&#8220;God bless you, little man!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the whole group of young folks,
determined to do the best they could for
what they had received, burst out again
in lusty chorus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;God rest you, merry Gentle Man!</div>
<div class="indent">Let nothing you dismay!</div>
<div class="verse">Remember Christ our Saviour</div>
<div class="indent">Was born on Christmas Day!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And Josiah McNason, listening quietly,
while the old carol was sung through, saw,
as he gazed beyond the children&#8217;s faces into
the Christmas morning sunshine, a tiny
Shape slowly disappearing into space&mdash;a
Shape so delicate as to seem no more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
one of the sunbeams,&mdash;while a voice, fine
and far, yet clear as a flute said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will!&#8221; he answered, under his breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the spirit of One Timothy Two,
good-bye!&#8221; whispered the Goblin&mdash;&#8220;Grace&mdash;Mercy&mdash;Peace!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Christmas Day!&#8221; said Josiah&mdash;&#8220;I
shall remember!&#8221;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&trade;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
